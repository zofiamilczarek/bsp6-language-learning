They are searching everywhere, on rocks, under rocks. Suddenly, while the boy is still on the rock, he gets hit by a deer and falls down a small cliff. The dog also falls and both of them are landing in a river. A broken tree that comes by is their help in danger because they catch it and make it out of the river.

He looks up to the window from where the trash was thrown out and picks the baby up.  <br/>  <br/> Right behind him arrives a woman with a Buggy. She seems to look for something.Chaplin tries to get her attention, while she is returning from entering a house entrance he sets the baby into the buggy to the other kid. The woman is furious and tells him after Chaplin wants to leave her with both kids in the buggy to take the kid back and he eventually does that and walks away. <br/>  <br/> Chaplin arrives at the spot where he found the baby and put it back while a policeman arrived behind him seriously scanning the Situation. Chaplin turning around and almost stumbling into the policeman returns to the baby, picks it up and walks around the corner and finds an elderly man with a walking stick. Chaplin puts the baby in his arms and fastly walks away after pretending he needs to tie up his shoe. <br/>  <br/> The elderly man quickly walks with the baby around the corner just to find a buggy with another kid inside where he places the baby and disappears. After he is gone the woman from before steps out of the entrance and looks at the buggy, gets annoyed and is likely to look for Charlie Chaplin who encounters again the police man and eventually passes without any reaction. She follows him, hits him with her umbrella and drags him back to the buggy. They argue about the baby when the policeman joints the situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby out of the buggy and walks away, so do the others.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin sits on the sidewalk thinking about putting the baby into a duct but then he rolls back.  <br/> He looks at the baby and finds a note saying that this baby is an orphan and needs love and care.  <br/> He smiles at the baby in his arms, gets up and walks away with it.

A few seconds later after smoking a cigarette, he discovers a child lying on the floor. He picks it up and searches for the mother. Afterwards, a mother with a child passes by. Chaplin thinks, that she might be the mother of the child. But that is not the case, because she denies being the mother. This leads to Chaplin laying the child back down where he found it, until a police officer appears. Without wanting to leave a bad impression, he picks up the child again and runs away, until he gives it to a homeless person on the way. The homeless person lays the child in a baby buggy, which belongs to the mother from a few moments ago. Of course there is no other than Charlie Chaplin who appears afterwards, which leads to the mother beating him up. The policeman appears afterwards as well, so Chaplin has to leave again with the baby. Sitting on the street with the kid, Chaplin discovers a letter and gets to know that the child has been abandoned by its parents. Finally, one can see Chaplin smiling towards the orphan holding it.

As he sees a woman passing by with a stroller, he suggests that it could be the mother of the baby. So he layed the baby in to the stroller. It turned out that it was not her baby. As a consequence she started mocking at Charlie, so he had to take it out of the stroller again. As he had no other idea where to place down the baby, he layed it back to the place he found the baby. But this move failed again. A officer cought him laying down the baby on the floor so he had to pick up the baby again. Once more he is disperately thinking of an other option. He encounters an old man, which he could hand over the baby with a ruse and flees right afterwards. This olderly man then sees the woman with the stroller, and puts it in the stroller as Charlie had done before. Therfore the woman suggested Charlie the one ho had put the baby in her stroller as Charlie crossed her way. She hits him with a umbrella and gives him back the baby. Charlie gives up and now realises that it is  an orphan baby as he finds a small letter which says to please take care of that orphan baby.

He hid in a parking lot, confused the older man searches for him and came across the stroller with a baby inside and just laid the baby he just recieved inside. As Chaplin wanted to leave the scene, the Police Officer appeared again and he knowingly avoids him. Thus he walks by the woman with the stroller, that noticed that the baby was inside her stroller again, she assumed that Chaplin had dropped it in there again and furiously attacks him with her umbrella. Angrily she drags him to the stroller and shouts at him, that he should take the baby and leave. Once again the police officer stepped into the scene and the woman seems to try to get his help but decided just to leave. Chaplin leaves the scene as well and decided to sit down on the roadside with the baby on his lap. He contemplates wherever he should get rid of the baby and looked suspiciously into the sewerage. He declined that thought and turned the baby into another position in his arms and notices a small letter in which is written that this baby is a orphan, a child without living parents and that someone should take care for the baby and treat it with love. As he realised the sad fate of this baby, he smiled at it and interacted with it quite caring and leaves the scene.

As he passed the street, a man threw stones out of his window which nearly hit Chaplin. Uninterested, Charly kept smoking his cigarette and kept walking. Suddenly, he was hit by a big stone from another unknown person. He stoped and pulled out a small box out of his inner jacket pocket. He opened the box, took out a new cigarette, put off his gloves, and touched his shoe sole in order to set fire to his cigarette. Not knowing where to put his gloves, he threw them in the can next to him. As the looked to the other side, he saw a baby left alone next to the ashes on the street. He went to the baby but then looked up to the windows, thinking whether someone threw the baby out or was missing it. Then he lifted the baby up and wasn‘t sure where to go. As he saw a woman with a trolley walking behind him, he followed her. She entered into the building while Charly laid the baby in her trolley. She came out and saw a second baby in her trolley, then saw Chaplin, shoutet at him and told him to take the baby. Charly went back to the spot where he found the baby and wanted to lay it there. But then a policeman saw his act and Charly took the baby again. He walked on and saw another old man and pretended that he had to tie his shoe but then ran away. The old man followed him and then saw the trolley and put the baby in the woman‘s trolley. The woman came out of yet another shop and saw Charly walking in front of her. She hit him with her umberella and forced him to take the baby again as the policeman saw the happening. Chaplin took the baby and went away. He sat down on the street and saw a gulli, opened it and looked at the baby but then closed it again. Then he saw a letter saying:“Please love and care for this orphan child“.  He put the letter in his pocket, smiled at the baby and left the scene.

Timmy took his dog with him and they were searching for the frog everywhere. They were screaming its name, climbing trees and rocks. Then suddenly Timmy grabbed something what he thought was part of a tree. But actually it was the horn of a deer. The deer did not really enjoy that and pushed Timmy and his dog into a river. Timmy and his dog swam over to the shore and climbed over a fallen tree to get out of the water. But what was that? Behind this tree there was a family of frogs and Timmy recognised his frog. It was the father of this family. He was really happy that he found him but did not want to take him away from his family. One of the baby frogs wanted to go with Timmy. So he grabbed him and took him home waving at the frog family. Everybody was happy and little Timmy finally had a frog to keep.

They decided to go out and search for the frog. They went to a forest and shouted out the frog's name. Unfortunately, the frog did not answer. They were searching in each corner of the forest. The boy even climbed on stones in order to shout out louder. When he did so, he was hit by an elk. As a consequence, he fell into small lake. The dog, as well, was hit by the elk and fell into the lake, too. When they got out of thhe water, they found the frog sitting behind a tree. They were surprised since the frog was not alone. He was accompanied by a whole family of frogs. Finally, the frog went back home with the boy and the dog and everyone was happy.

Suddenly someone throughs out garbage from an open window, he manages to step aside. A few steps later he is not that lucky. In anger Chaplin recognizes that is cigarette was blown out and he takes out a new one with very explicit movements which is characteristic for Charlie Chaplins slapstick scenes. Afterwards he looks around and discovers a crying baby laying between a wall and some trashcans. Meanwhile a young mother walks past in the background with a pushchair and a baby. Chaplin sees her and as she shortly walks into a house he places the baby next to the child of the unknown women. Unfortunately she walks out again just in this very moment and does not seem amused at all. So he then tries something else and carries the baby back to the place where he found it. Just as he turns around to walk away a man in uniform stands a few steps behind him giving him a strict look that makes Chaplin taking the child back on immediately. Another set appears, Chaplin walks down a street to an old man and hands him the baby, pretending to fix his shoe laces so he can run away. The old man chases him but is not able to move fast enough. He walks past the pushchair of the lady from the first scene and tries the same trick as Chaplin did before. He gets along with it but as soon as the mother walks out a magazine door and sees the second child she starts to search the street. Chaplin passes by, thinking himself safe as the mother runs after him and slaps him with her umbrella. He has to take the baby back and in the last scene he sits down on the street with the little child in his arm wondering what to do with it. Looking at its face and little clothing he discovers a piece of paper, unfolds it and after reading he know nows that this is an orphan child someone hoped that good people would care about. He smiles and then walks off into the distance, carrying his new child.

While he tries to figure out where the child’s mother might be, a woman with a baby stroller enters the stage. Assuming she is the mother, he lays the newborn into the stroller, next to the woman’s child. As she is not the mother, she indignantly urges him to pick up his child and leaves the alleyway. While Mister Chaplin is laying down the newborn next to the trashcan again, a police officer enters the alleyway – Mister Chaplin is forced to take the child again. By a trick he hands over the child to a stranger, who is laying down the child in the baby stroller of the mother, who entered the alleyway earlier. After that Mister Chaplin walks across the stroller and, again, gets forced to pick the child up by the woman and the patrolling police officer.

Behind a trashcan he finds a little baby wrapped in a blanket. A woman with a buggy walks by and he is thinking that she lots the baby and puts it into her buggy. Then she is in rage and tells him that this is not her baby. Charlie goes back to the place where he found the baby and lays it down, right back behind the trashcan. A police officer appears and seems to think that Charlie tries to abandon the baby. To avoid serious trouble, Charlie takes the baby with him down the street. He asks an old man with a walking stick to hold the baby for a moment and runs way. The old man can't find Charlie, but spots a buggy (the same of the woman at the beginning of the story) and lays the baby in the buggy and runs away. Charlie walks by a few seconds later and the woman comes out of a store, finding the foreign baby in her buggy again. She sees Charlie and beats him with her umbrella. Again the police officer walks by, to avoid serious trouble again, Charlie takes the baby and sits down the street on the sidewalk. He thinks about to throw the child into a sewer, but rejects that thought. He finds a letter in the blanket, which says to care for this orphaned child. He smiles at the baby and takes it with him.

Since his attempts of leaving the baby in another woman's stroller remain unsuccessful and the idea of giving the baby to strangers turns out the same way, he gets used to keeping the baby.

Or is it a she? The frog sits in his jar at the end of the boy's bed. During the night, when both Tom and Jimmy are asleep, the frog climbs out of the jar. In the morning,Tom and Jimmy wake up and see, that the frog is gone. Immediatly, they start looking for him. ""Froooog!"", shouts Tom, because they had not come up with a name yet. Jimmy is houling as well. The boy climbs up on a tree, the dog searches the ground, but they see no sign of the frog. <br/>  Tom then climbs a rock,leaning on a tree, not knowing that the tree is in deed a deer. The deer promptly throughs Tom and Jimmy of a little cliff, where they land in a little lake with a loud splash. While climbing out, they see the frog, who is obviously a male, since he is sitting there with what appears to be a lady-frog and many baby frogs. Since Tom and Jimmy know, that the frog now has dad-duties, they can impossibly take him with them. They then decide to take one of the frog children,whanting to show him or her - it looks like a him- a life outside the woods. Since dad-frog already realised that Tom and Jimmy are two lovable, caring ones, he approves of this idea. He is probably going to visit them soon, or maybe they will come back, who knows?  <br/>  The boy and the dog wave at the frog family, taking Billy, their own newest family member, with them."

Every night the boy and the dog were watching the frog until they fell asleep, but one night, when both of them were asleep, the frog managed to escape. When the boy and his dog woke up and noticed that the frog was gone they were desperate and decided to go out into the forest and look for him. After hours of searching all over the forest they still couldn't find the frog. They stepped on rocks, climbed on trees and even got to know other animals living in the forest. One of those animals was a deer. When the boy climbed on the deer's back looking for the frog it pushed him and his dog of an edge. The puddle of mud they fell in was right next to a fallen tree where they coincidentally found the frog and his whole family. The boy knew he couldn't take all of them and especially not the father, so he decided to take one of the smaller ones to take home with him and raise it.

While walking a man in an apartment is throwing out some building rubble, Chaplin is not getting hit by it but is cleaning his suit from the dusk. As he keeps walking there's another man who is throwing  rubbish out of the window. This time Chaplin get hit and is getting angry. To recover of the stress he's putting his cigarrettes out of a box in his pocket. Before starting to smoke he's pulling off his gloves. It seems like he lights the match on his shoe. While smoking he's looking around and recognizes a baby who is laying next to the rubbish bins. Chaplin starts looking around to find someone who might be the one responsible for the child, but can't find anyone. While he's grabbing the baby a woman with a stroller, with already one baby sitting in in, passes by. As soon as the woman stopped to go into the building Chaplin puts the baby he found in the woman's stroller. In this moment the woman is coming out of the door and starts shouting at him to make cleare, that it's not her child,. That's why Charles takes the child back into his arms again and is walking away. He wants to put the baby pack to the place where he found it but a police officer passed by at this moment, so Charles decided to walk away with the baby. On his way he comes across a older man with a walking stick, Charles is acting like tying his shoes to be able to put the baby into the arms of the old man. After a few seconds he starts running away and leaves the man alone with the baby. The old man starts running after him, but can't find Charles who is hiding behind a door. His way leads the man to the stroller of the woman earlier and like Chaplin did, he puts the baby in the stroller and runs away. As soon as Charles comes out of his hiding place he's running into the arms of the police officer again. Meanwhile the women comes out of the building and finds the baby again in her stroller. Charles walks by the stroller again and the woman recognize him and is starting to hit him with her umbrella whilst pulling him back to the stroller with the two babys. While arguing with the women the police officer passes by who became aware of the situation, the fight led to nothing and Charles grabs the baby again and walks away. He's sitting down on a kerb with the babys in his arms. Next to him is a discharge shaft and for a short moment he's thinking about putting the baby in there - but he decides otherwise. He's taking a closer look at the baby and finds a note in the cover which is saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". That's why he decides to take care of the lonely child and takes it with him."

Suddenly the stick were moving and too late the boy realised that his 'stick' actually belonged to a deer. The deer took the boy and the dog and threw them into a lake nearby.

The boy started looking for the frog and he ran out of the house into the forest nearby, always together with his faithful dog. In the middle of the forest they had no fear but were only thinking about his little friend Marvin, the frog. They both were running and shouting here and there in the dense woodland, eben the dog was looking up to each single tree. Even the boy climbed up a big stone to watch better all around. Unfortunately behind the stone there was the cave of a big white deer who felt disturbed by all the noise of the shouting boy and his dog. The white deer jumped out of the bushes to the boy and kicked him into a lake next to the stone together with his dog. They both fell deep into the water - ouch - nevertheless after a while they succeeded in climbing out of the lake on to a branch of rodden wood, and there, at the border of the lake, finaly they found Marvin. How surprised they were to see that Marvin wasn't no longer alone. He was sitting there on another big branch together with his new friend, Michel, a second frog. So now they have been al together again, the boy, his dog and the two frogs spending happy days in the forest.

The lady is not amused and Charles Chaplin brings the baby back to where he found it but a policeman is watching him – so he keeps the child. Under the pretext of having to close his shoes, he gives the baby to a stranger and runs away. The stranger however lays the baby again in the woman’s pram who is in a shop in the meantime and the stranger leaves. Charles Chaplin walks past the pram in the moment when the woman sees the baby in her pram. In this moment the policeman arrives and after a short discussion Charles Chaplin leaves – together with the child. He sits down on a pavement.

The old man walks to a road where he sees the stroller from the same women Charlie had argued with in the beginning. He puts the baby inside the stroller and runs away. Meanwhile, Charlie gets caught coming out of his hiding spot by the Police officer. Charlie runs away again, directly onto the street where the women was with the stroller.

The frog seemed to be hurt so right away the boy decided to take the poor animal home with him. After they have walked all the way back home and put the frog in a big glass jar the boy and his dog wanted the frog to recover from all the stress he had. It was a lon exhausting day so the boy and dog went to bed to catch some sleep. Waking up the next morning the boy worringly could see that the hurt frog has disappeared. He grabbed his dog and ran ourside to look everywhere for the little animal. Behind the trees in all the bushes and little holes but they couldn't find the frog anywere. The boy decided to climb on a big rock to have a better overview. Suddenly he fell over and landed in the bushes. What he didnt know was that there was a massive deer in there and he basicly fell on the deer's head. Reacting shocked and wanting to protect itself the deer ran after the boy and dog and pushed them down a small cliff. Luckily they landed in a lake so they didnt get hurt at all. The boy and dog carred themselves out of the water and because they were so exhausted of searching for their little frog friend they leaned over an old fallen down tree.What they were able to see behind this tree was unbelievable.There he was their little frog, looking at them and seeming to be alright again. He wasn't even alone, no, he was with his frog girlfriend and children. The boy and dog were so happythey have found him and were even more pleased about the fact that the fog has a lovely family that cares for him.

When he passes the houses he is always hit by objects that somebody throws out of the window. After a while he reaches a place of dustbins where there is no risk of falling items anymore. When he calmly smokes a cigarette he notices a bundle of clothes behind one of the containers. Charlie Chaplin soon finds out that there is a baby inside the bundle. At first, he assumes the baby fell out of a window, then he sees a mother with a child in a pushchair and thinks that this woman could have dropped the other baby. However, he tries to get the woman's attention in vain. That's why Charlie Chaplin simply puts the baby into the lady's pushchair. When the woman finds out that there is another baby in her child's pushchair she becomes very angry and insistes Charlie Chaplin to fetch back the baby. When Charlie Chaplin decides to put the baby back where he had found it he is caught by a policeman. In his next attempt to get rid of the baby Charlie Chaplin tries to give the little child to a man, who carries a walking stick. <br/> The man does not want to be responsible for the baby and puts it again into the woman's pushchair. When the lady discovers that the strange baby is back in her child's pushchair she is very furious, chases Charlie Chaplin, hits him with her umbrella and forces him to fetch back the baby. Eventually, Charlie Chaplin feels so overwhelmed with his duty to care for the child that he considers to throw it into gully. When he discovers a note into the baby's bundle that begs the finder to lovingly care for this orphan Charlie Chaplin changes his opinion and decides to look after the child."

After some days, while Benny was asleep the frog climbed out of the glass and left the house. Neither Benny nor Bunker were able to understand why the frog had left when they realized he had gone. Therefore, Benny and Bunker decided to look for the frog. They went into a nearby forest and shouted in the woods. Benny climbed a tree and a rock. Suddenly the rock turned out to be an elk. The elk rose so that Benny and Bunker were tossed down a cliff. They fell into a pond. After getting out of the water they sat down on a trunk. Coincidentally looking around, Benny saw the frog. Yet the frog was not alone. There were eight frogs sitting in a circle. Now Benny understood. He could not be the frog's friend or family as the frog already had one. So Benny and Bunker decided to leave the frogs alone and waved to say goodbye. They returned home and thought about their little adevnture.

Since he doesn't know what to do with the child, he tries to get rid of the kid, first by putting it into a somebody else's pram, maybe assuming that the child belongs to this woman, who, however, chases them away angrily. When Charlie wants to put the child back to where he found it, a police officer watches him, thinking that Charlie wants to abandon the child. After that Charlie takes off, together with the kid. He meets a passer-by, slipping the child into the passer-by's hand, before taking off again. The man who's got the child now unknowingly puts it into the same pram as Charlie did before. When the woman realizes that the unknown child is back again in her pram, she immediately thinks of Charlie who passes the street at that very moment. After getting beaten up by that lady and while argueing the police officer walks over and Charlie sees himself forced to take the child with him one more time. Then, he sits down on the roadside. When he notices a drain right next to him, he considers to throw the kid into it for a second but he decides not to do it. Shortly after, he finds a note in the child's cloth, saying that this child is an orphan that needs to be taken care of and that needs to be loved.

While grabing and igniting a new cigar he finds a crying baby and tries to find the parents of the baby. The secong after a woman with a pram walks by and immediately Charles puts the baby in the pram saying:""Pardon, me you dropped something."" with a suprising hostile reaction of the woman. Just after the interaction with the lady Charles carries the baby back to the place where he had found  it getting caught by a police officer and nervously picking up the baby again. On his way Charles met an elderly man tricking him into holding the baby whilst he ties his shoes and secretly runs away.While Charles arrived in the mentioned alley hidding from the old man, the old man is seeking for him but finds the pram of the lady Charles met earlier. Then when Charles leaves his hidding spot he gets confronted by the same police officer again and just as he had escaped the policeman Charles walks by the pram while the lady notices that the baby from earlier is yet again in her pram. The lady then sees Charles putting him into dust and dragging him to the pram. Now the policeman had arrived at the pram and both the lady and the policeman are forcing Charles to take the baby. At the end while still searching for a solution for the baby problem Charles finds a note with the writing:""Please love and care for this orphan child"" After sitting on a wayside he stands up smilling the baby in his arms and walks away."

He was so proud and happy to have a new animal friend besides his doggy. ,The boy was sleeping in his bed and didn't notice that the frog was escaping from his little glass prison.As soon as he woke up , he looked at the jar to check up on his little friend but to his surprise the jar was empty. Where was his froggy? Together with his dog he tried to figure out where he could have gone but all this thinking and not doing anything about it killed the boy. So he set off on the quest to find the little frog with his dog , because two eyes and a dog nose should be able to find the wild frog. They look all over the forest where he found the frog when he first caught it. He climbed trees and stones and yelled for his lost friend at the top of his lungs.While he was standing on a particularly big stone, he leaned over to hold onto what appeared to be branches from a tree but those branch suddenly began to move and picked him up. It was a deer with his giant antlers who carried him to a cliff and threw him off the edge. The poor boy fell into a river where he struggled not to drown. Luckily, he managed to pull him self onto a log that was close. He sat on the log for a while to rest when he spotted a frog family and imagine that -one of the bunch was his little lost froggy friend! The boy,his doggy and the frog are happy to be reunited and lived happily ever after.One day there was a little boy sitting on the bedroom floor with his dog. It was later in the evening and dark outside. The two of them were whatching a frog sitting in a glass between them. After a while the boy went to bed and his dog lay down on his legs. When they were sleeping suddenly the frog klimbed out of the glass and jumped through the window. When the boy and his dog woke up in the morning they discovered the empty glass and were very surpised and shocked. The boy dressed himself and ran out of the house always followed by his dog. They started to search for the frog. They went into the forest and screamed and looked erverywhere for the frog. Then the boy climbed onto a rock to see a little more. What he didn't notice was a male (...) standing just behind the rock. When the boy tried to hold himself at the horn of the (..) it caught him right in the shirt and threw him in the pond next to them. The dog fell with him and they both swam to a fallen tree just at the boarder of the pond. When they climbed over the tree they suddenly discovered their frog with it's whole family sitting together.

James and his dog fell into a small lake and as they wanted to get out of the water with the help of a fallen tree, he suddenly saw the frog. He was very happy about this and wanted to take it home with him again but then he realized that the frog was surrounded by its family and seemed very happy.

They started to look for a frog. <br/>  They went outside and started to call it. They went to the park: there was no frog under the stone, there was no frog on the tree and on the hill either. Boy called the frog, but it didn't come. <br/>  And then being on the hill the boy stumbled upon the antlers! It was a deer, he threw the boy into the swamp. The dog fell after him. While getting out from the water, the boy and the dog saw the frog family sitting near the log. Their frog was with that frog family. It was happy to see the boy. <br/>  The boy took it, said buy to the frog family and they three went together home.

After a few moments, he notices a woman with a stroller. He assumes it must be her child and lays the baby down. However, it seems like this is not the case and Chaplin has to continue looking for the baby's parents. He figures that they were going to pick the baby up eventually and leaves it where he found it, only to pick it up shortly after. A policeman came around the corner and to ihm, it must've looked like Chaplin was going to leave his own child in the alley. Chaplin then tries to hand the baby to an old man by tricking him to hold it while tying his shoes. He flees from the man, who comes by the lady with the stroller again and, just as Chaplin did before, assumes it's her baby. When the woman comes back to her stroller and the unfamiliar baby, she spots Chaplin walking by and punches him. She then hands him the baby. Chaplin, holding the baby again, sits down on the sidewalk when he notices a piece of paper inbetween the baby's blanket. The child appears to be an orphan and Chaplin smiles, looks at the child and walks away holding it.

The frog is in a glass so that he will not leave, but he seems quite happy. With them, there is a dog, who also seems to like the little frog. In fact, they seem to be really interested in the its behaviour.  <br/>  When the little boy goes to sleep at night, the little frog decides to leave. Since the glass has been left open, he can easily escape.  <br/>  The next morning, the boy wakes up and is shocked: The little frog is gone! Consequently, he decides to look for him and goes into the woods. He calls his frog's name, but does not get any reply. His dog and him try to find their friend in various places: they even have a look into a tree. During their time in the forest, the boy tries to look everywhere and even gets into an interesting situation with a deer, who throws him into water. Now it becomes clear that the little boy really has to go through a lot to find his friend. In the end, he looks behind a tree and finds the frog he has been looking for. His little friend is surrounded by other frogs, possibily his family. Lastly, the young boy leaves with the dog and waves the frogs goodbye. Obviously, he has agreed to let him live with his family and goes home without him.

He is wearing a suit with a tie, a hat and gloves. He almost gets hit by something a woman throws out of her window. After litting a cigarette and getting rid of the gloves, a crying baby in a blanket on the floor draws his attention. He picks it up and looks around to see where it comes from. Then, he sees a woman strolling with a baby carriage with a baby. She leaves the carriage in front of a house and enters. Chaplin seizes this opportunity and puts his baby next to the other one in the carriage and says ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". The woman gets angry, then Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. He goes back to the place where he found it, wants to put it back on the floor but then, a man who appears to be an officer observes him which makes Chaplin take the baby with him. On his way, the crosses paths with an old man. He asks him to hold the baby while pretending to tie his shoes. Then, he runs away and hides. The old man follows him. He sees the same carriage with the baby Chaplin saw before. He puts in in and runs away. Meanwhile, Chaplin comes out of his hiding place and bumps into the officer. He then walks in the other direction, past the woman who comes out of the store and sees two babies in her carriage. She runs after Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Even though the video is voiceless, only with music put to it, you can tell that they are having a wild discussion.The officer sees that and listens to them without saying a word. Afterwards, Chaplin takes the baby and sits down on the pavement. After thinking about where to put the baby, he finds a piece of paper in its blanket that says ""Please love and take care for this orpan child"". Finally, the cuddles the baby, laughs at it and takes it with him."

The man tries to catch Chaplin, but then sees the same stroller Chaplin saw earlier, standing in front of a store. He puts the baby inside of it and walks away. As the woman is coming out of the store, Chaplin is walking past the store. The woman is hitting him with her umbrella, thinking that he must have put the baby back in her stroller and she informs the police officer about it.

While doing so a woman throws her trash out of the window and almost hits him. A few seconds and meters later, an unknown persons who we do not see, does the same and hits him. Charlie is obviously angry and lights a cigarette. Just seconds after that he finds a baby, covered in sheets laying on the ground. He wonders if it was also just thrown out of the window or to whom it belongs. As a woman with a baby carriage passes by he chases her and wants to put it back in there because he believes that she lost one of hers. The woman gets furious as it turns out not to be her child and he walks away with the orphan. Charlie seems to be unable to cope with the situation and tries to get rid of the baby. But as he puts it back to the place where he found it, a policeman catches him and he instantly picks it back up. Still trying to get rid of the baby, he gives it to an old man who can barely walk and runs away. But the old man comes up with the same idea as Charlie did, he puts the baby inside the buggy of the woman. Unfortunately she realizes that the orphan was put in her baby carriage the moment Charlie walks past. She chases him down, beats him up and makes him take the baby. He has no other choice than to do so because the policeman appears again. Frustrated by the situation, Charlie sits down on the curb and even thinks of throwing the orphan in the drain. A few moments later, after finding a letter which says ""please love and care for this orphan child"", his mood suddenly lights up and he feels responsible. At the end he walks away with the baby and disappears in a small side street."

Wondering where it came from, he starts looking around. As he passes some trashcans, he finds a baby laying behind them. He picks it up and holds it close to him. He again starts looking around, now wondering who might left the baby on the floor. A few moments later, a mother with her child in a stroller walk by. He sees this as an opportunity to leave the baby to this mother and puts the baby to hers in the stroller. After realizing what Chaplin has done, the mother angrily tells him to take the baby back. As the mother turned him down, Chaplin just puts the baby back where he found it. In exact this moment, a police officer passes and just watches him. Chaplin realizes that he is being watched and therefore decides to pick the baby up again, so he will not get arrested. He now walks through the neighbor, looking for a solution. When he walks past by a random bystander, he asks him to hold the baby for a moment, but then starts running away and hides. The man who holds the baby now, is confused and puts the baby in the same stroller from the mother, from the beginning of the film. Chaplin, sure about his accomplishment, casually walks by the mother again, but she recognizes him and attacks Chaplin and drags him back to the stroller, asking him to take the baby back. They start to argue, but when the police officer passes again, Chaplin willingly takes the baby back, again to avoid a punishment. It now seems like, that Chaplin gave up.

This child also had another close friend, a small frog, which he put into a glass bottle home. Every day they played together and spent a lot of time together, making them true friends. Until someday the little frog slipped out of his bottle and ran away from home. When the boy realized the frog's disappearance, he was shocked and went outside with his dog to look for him. He shouted his frog's name and looked into treeholes, while the dog destroyed a home of bees. The search seemed hopeless until the boy climbed up a rock to get a better view. Then something pushed him off the cliff and while he was falling, he saw that a deer was responsible for it. The child fell into a swamp, where his dog already waited and pulled him to land. Finally, the boy gathered himself, looked around him and saw he was in the middle of a frog swamp. His own frog friend was one of them. The boy grasped his friend happily and waved goodbye to the other frogs. In the end, the child went home with both his friends and lived a normal life again.

In the morning they found the green little hopper missing. Even before breakfast, Timmy and Jasper went into the forest searching for the frog. ""Frog, where are you? Froggy, Fro-hog, Mr. Frog,"" Timmy shouted towards the trees. Jasper went looking at the smaller places, even met some bees who were nice enough not to sting him, and Timmy went for the bigger hiding places, climbed trees and big rocks. Because the rock was covered in moss, Timmy grabbed a treebranch to hold on to. But, oh no! That wasn't a treebranch, it was a deer standing behind the rock. Timmy fell over onto its head and grabbed his crown harder. The deer didn't like that very much and started running and jumping to get little Timmy off his head. He stopped right before a small cliff so harshely, that Timmy couldn't hold on much longer and fell over into a little pond below. Luckily Jasper found him sitting in the cold, muddy water and helped him to get out. But, what was that? Timmy had heard a loud, familiar sound. Behind a dead treestem he looked for the noisemaker. It was his frog and - wow - his little frogfamily. ""Good morning, Mr. Frog, Mrs Frog and you little froggy baby's."", Timmy whispered not to scare them. One of the baby frogs really wasn't scared at all. He hopped towards Timmy and said ""Ribbit!"" Jasper seemed surprised but a second after he licked the small frog all over its back. Timmy heard a grumpling sound from somewhere down and felt his tummy and suddenly also his hunger. As he stood up, he saw the little frog jumping towards him and caught him in his hand. It seemed, he wanted to come with them. So Timmy said goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Frog, walked trought the pond and was lookig forward to the breakfast. Maybe his mother had some flies left in the kitchen for his new little green friend."

After that he noticed a crying baby in the alley. While picking the baby up a woman with a stroller is walking past them. Chaplin notices the stroller and tries to put the baby in the stroller. The woman was furious as Chaplin said that she had dropped something. He had to pick the baby up again because it wasn't the baby of that woman. As Chaplin is trying to place the baby back into the alley a officer is walking by and so he's picking the baby back up. He then askes an elder man to hold the baby for a moment to tie his laces. While the elder man is holding the baby, Chaplin is making a run for it. He's hiding in the alley and the elder man passes by the stroller of the lady before. The elder man deploys the baby in the stroller and runs off. The woman noticed the other baby in the stroller as Chaplin was walking by and then she suckerpunched Chaplin with a umbrella. The officer also passed by and Chaplin took the baby and went off. He then sits down and considers to throw the baby in the sewerage.Chaplin notices a letter on the baby which said that someone should take care of the baby.

One night Timmy and his two pets - a puppy named Bo and a green frog named Tammy - were sitting on the floor of his bedroom and listening to the dark night and the whisper of the wind. As usual Tammy was captured in a glass jar, so the frog would not run away (which she loved to do when noone was looking). Later that night Timmy went to bed, and even Bo managed to get some sleep, even though thunder and wind of the night were knocking at the bedroom's window. Suddenly Tammy the frog silently climed out of her glass jar and escaped through the half open window into the darkness. The next morning Timmy and Bo woke up in utter shock. They realized the second that they opened their eyes that something was different: Tammy had escaped and left them. The frog was gone and off to her very own adventure. Timmy and Bo started looking for the frog in the nearby forrest. They yelled her Name ""Tammy, Tammy"" over and over again, but noone answered. When they got deeper into the dark woods, there still was no sight of the green, little frog. Finally, Timmy climed a big rock to get a better view of his surroundings. Just as he started to yell out ""Tammy"" again, a deer suprised him. The gigantic animal lifted poor little Timmy up and carried the boy a few steps away. Sad little Bo had to watch the deer dropping his friend in the cold waters of the nearby river. Bo also fell into the water in a desperate attempt to save Timmy. The boy fell head down first into the water - it was quite a rough landing. However: Luckily Timmy and Bo both survived and found themselves laying on a floating tree stem. Both of them laughted again and were very happy to find themselves alive. But not only this. When the tree stem floated a little bit further, Timmy and Bo caught sight of frog Tammy. They could not believe their eyes when they saw the Tammy was now a wife of another green frog and had a couple of children to her side as well. Timmy was incredibly happy to find his friend alive and so happy with her very own family. He decided to leave Tammy in the forrest, where she could live happily ever after with her own frog-family. And so did Timmy and his little dog, when they ultimately returned home to his house by the forrest."

He then takes the child again and wants to put it back to where he found it, but because a policeman is watching him he leaves with the baby in his arms. After that he walks by an old man and ask him to hold the baby as he wants to tie up his shoe. But he is just pretending and leaves without the baby. The old man then walks through the streets, looking for a way to get rid of the baby. He sees a stroller, put the baby in it and leaves as well. The stroller is the one belonging to the woman Chaplin met before. When she gets out of the store she gets upset because the baby is back with her. At the same time, Charlie Chaplin walks by and she then assumes that he is responsible for it again and hits him with an umbrella. The police man joins the situation and Chaplin better leaves with the baby because the woman accuses him. Without knowing what to do he sits down on the curb. While he is looking at the baby he finds a piece of paper that states that someone should please love and take care of the orphan. Touched by this he stands up and leaves, holding the baby in his arms.

After a while, Tim and his dog went to bed and imediately fell asleep. The frog knew that he was able to get free again and jumped out of the jar. Whenever the little boy woke up, he realized that the frog was gone. He felt bad for the frog and, together with his dog, he went to the woods to look after the frog. They called him, but of course, the frog did not answer the two. Tim had an idea and started to search in every little hole he could find: while he climbed onto an old tree to see if the frog was hiding up there, the dog started to see if the frog hid in an bee's home, but the frog could not be found anywhere. From the tree, Tim saw a big stone in the woods, on that he climbed to have a better overview over the area. While he sat on it and screamed for the frog , a deer appeared and took Tim on his head. He walked a few metres and threw him and his dog into a pond. Tim was really mad at the deer and in addition to that he was all wet, but did not give up searching. Suddenly, the two heard a sound behind an old branch of wood and got interested. They looked behind it and found the frog and his family sitting together happily. Tim had no idea that the only thing the frog wanted, was to be with his family and did not realize that the frog might be unhappy being alone in a jar. Tim took one of the frogs into his hands and thought about the pleasure he had watching the frog in his jar the day before. Finally, Tim and his dog were happy about their finding and took the frog home again.

After a few metres, he gets hit by bricks which seem to have been thrown down at him from someone in the house on the side of the street. Charlie Chaplin looks confused and tries to figure out who threw them at him. He then grabs a box with cigarettes and lights one with his show. While smoking, he takes closer looks at the surroundings and notices a baby on the ground, laying beside a garbage bin. Slowly, he approaches the bunch and looks at it, before taking it up and holding it in front of his face for closer inspection. He then searches for an opportunity to get rid of the baby and sees a woman with pram, which he then follows in order to lay down the baby in a moment when the woman does not pay attention to him. Unfortunately for him, she sees him and screams at him to take the child away. After that, Charlie Chaplin returns to the garbage bin and puts the baby back on the ground, when a police man appears behind him, urging him to take the baby back in his arms. Charlie Chaplin walks away and takes one last chance to get rid of the child when he gives it away to a beggar, before running away. The beggar looks confused, tries to follow him but can not manage to catch up. Instead, he passes the lady with the pram again, who again is not paying attention. The beggar puts the baby down in the pram, just like Charlie Chaplin did before, then walks away. At the same time when the lady enters the street again and discovers the second baby in the pram, Charlie Chaplin passes her. She confrontates him violently. At the end, Charlie Chaplin accepts the kid on his arm, sits down with it and reads a note that had been written for the person who finds it. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"", it says. Charlie Chaplin smiles, and walks away with the kid in his arms."

Charles has to move out of the way to not get hit. He continues walking while he's havin a smoke. He then gets hit by somebody else throwing out bricks. He dusts himself off and lights another cigarette. Afterwards he finds a baby laying on the floor which he wants to give to a woman who is strolling by with a trolley but it appears that it's not her kid. Charles takes the kid and wants to put it back where he found it. But a police officer walks by and gives him a warning look. Charles then picks the baby back up and continues walking. He passes an older gentleman, puts the baby in his arms and runs away to hide. The old man sees the trolley and puts the baby into it without the woman noticing and walks off. Next thing you see is Charles coming out of his hiding place. He walks past the woman who sees the baby back in her trolley and follows Charles and calls the police officer. Charles then takes the baby and continues his journey. He sits down and seems to think. He then finds a note in the baby's pocket which reads: Please love and care for this orphan child. He smiles at the baby and walks off the scene with the kid in his arms.

Chaplin continues walking until he finally is hit by the litter of someone else's dustbin. Between garbage cans, he eventually notices a crying baby, wrapped up in a cloth, which someone must have left there on purpose. Chaplin picks the baby up and looks for someone to whom the baby might belong to. Eventually, a woman passes while pushing a pram with a baby inside. Chaplin assumes that the baby he found on the floor belongs to her and that she obviously must have dropped it without noticing. However, she makes clear that it is not hers and also feels rather offended by Chaplin's assumption. Chaplin takes the baby out of the pram and intends to lay it back to the place where he found it. He stays not unnoticed though as a policeman watches Chaplin. So instead of getting help by the officer, Chaplin prefers to take the baby with him and obviously wants to drop it somewhere else. Then an old stranger with a walking stick comes in handy and Chaplin gives the baby to him and runs away afterwards. The old man,  however, does not want to keep it and is desperately looking for Chaplin to return the baby but without any success. When the old man sees a pram left alone in front of a shop, he sees his chance to get rid of it and finally puts the baby in the pram. As the woman, to whom the pram belongs to, comes out of the shop and notices the  baby she suspects Chaplin again who is, unfortunately, passing the pram right at that moment. After all, Chaplin is given back the baby and keeps it after he found a tag lying between the layers of the cloth saying that the baby is an orphan and needs someone to love and care for it.

The old man tries to follow him and walks by the same baby carriage as Charles did before. He lies the baby down next to the other baby and leaves.  <br/> Charles Chaplin leaves his hiding spot and accidentally crosses the woman with the baby carriage. The woman hits him with an umbrella and forces him to take the baby again. <br/> At the end, he sits down on a sidewalk next to a drain and thinks about hiding the baby in there.  <br/> After all, Chaplin pulls a letter out of the baby's blanket, which says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

In the back a person is throwing things out of the window. A person, presumably Charly Chaplin, walks underneath that window. He realises the things falling down from above, but is not noticeably disturbed by it. He starts smoking and moves into the foreground. Then again, things are falling down from above. A text appears: 'Awkward ass'. Charly Chaplin takes a look into the bin next to him. He pulls a cigarette out of a metal box and puts it into his mouth. The, he takes off his gloves and lits the cigarette. He throws his gloves into the bin. Following his view, we can see a baby laying on the ground next to a wall. Chaplin watches out for people. He picks up the baby and moves into the back. He raises his arm to get the attention of a woman passing by. We see a buggy. Charly Chaplin puts the baby into the buggy. The woman appears and both argue, presumably about who is going to take care of the baby. Charly takes the baby out of the buggy and both persons leave in different directions. As Charly lays down the baby, a policeman arrives. Charly turns around, spots the policeman and picks the baby up again. In a different location we can see a man walking next to Chaplin. Charly indicates that he wants to tie his shoelaces and hands the baby over to the man. Then he runs into the back. The man follows Charly, who hides in a garage. The man lays the baby down into another buggy, in which we can also spot another baby. Then he leaves. Charly comes out of his stash, running into the policeman. He is passing by the buggy with the two babys. The same woman from earlier comes out of a house, sees Charly and follows him. She hits him with an umbrella and then drags him towards the buggy. They start arguing again. The policeman notices the two people arguing. Charly takes the baby out of the buggy again and leaves. He sits down on the sidewalk, shortly considering to throw the baby down the drain. He finds a note in the baby's clothes and reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Then he looks at the baby and takes it with him.

Later that night, the frog escaped from his jar. The next morning, the little boy woke up and had a look at the frog's jar. But his freind was gone. The boy and his dog started searching for him. Their search also led them through the forest. To get an overview, the boy climbed on a rock and held onto a branch. Turns out, that it was no branch, he was holing onto - It was a deer, that lifted the boy up and threw him and his dog into a lake. The two got out of the lake and after climbing over a tree stem, lying on the ground, they discovered a little frog familiy. Their befriended frog was one of them. Happy that they have found the frog again, they took him back home. The End.

He imagined the adventures he would have with the dog and was happy to have him as a pet. At night, when the boy and the dog were asleep, the little frog decided to escape his glass home and go on a journey. When the boy woke up in the morning, he was shocked not finding his frog in the glass. He missed him and was sad because of all the adventures that he planned to have with the frog and that now would never happen, since the frog was not there anymore. The boy decided to go outside and look for his frog with the dog. They went to the fields and forests and screamed the little frogs name as loud as their bodies were able to. But they couldn't find the frog. Neither in the fields, nor in the forests. Not even inside of any tree the little boy climed into. The frustrated little boy saw a rock that was not to big for him to climb it and just big enough to be able to look over the bushes when standing on it. Unluckily a deer was hiding behind the rock, wanting to spend some time alone. As the dear was not amused for a shouting little boy to disturb his peace, it took the little boy on his head and pushed him and his little dog into the nearby river. The two fell into the river and escaped soaking wet to the next piece of wood that was lying on the riverside. When they managed to get on the other side of the piece of wood to save themselves, they found the little frog they were searching for sitting on the ground. The frog was visiting his family, which also sat on the ground, looking up to the boy and the dog. The frog decided to come back home with the boy and the dog, thinking that he had spend enough holiday time and being exhausted from the long walk around the forest. The boy, the dog and the frog friendly waved goodbye, as they were heading back home.

He grabs into his pocket, pulls out a little box and takes out a cigarette, which he shoves into his mouth. In this moment, he notices a baby laying besides one of the trash cans. He looks around, looking for the parents or any other person, who is responsible for the child. He sees a lady walking by, stops her and puts the baby inside her wagon. The woman is not happy about it and tells him to get the baby out of her wagon, because it is obviously not hers. A policeman is standing beside Chaplin, as he tries to lay the baby back to where he found it, but takes it back from the ground, as he notices that he is being watched by him. Chaplin proceeds trying to find someone, who will take care of the baby, but no one seems to be responsible. In the end, Chaplin sits at the sidewalk and reads a letter, which is attached to the babys blanket. Written there is a begging to whoever finds the child in the street, asking the finder to take care of it, because it's an orphan. Chaplin smiles and walks away, with the baby in his arms.

And before he even really realised what happened was he sitting on the head of the dear. The dear threw him into a little pont and left. When the boy finally got out of the water and climbed over a fallen tree he suddenly saw his frog. But the frog wasn't alone. He had a family! Next to him was another big frog and a few little ones were sitting beside them. So the boy knew that the frog wasn't running away from him, he just wanted to be back together with his family. So the boy and the dog left knowing that the frog is happy.

A woman throws something out of the window, but Charlie walks on unconcerned. Farther into the lane he finally gets hit by some rubbish someone threw out of the window. Hence his cigar fell on the ground, he takes a new one out of his tiny metal box, which he carries in his chest pocket. When he throws his gloves away he suddenly sees a baby lying on the ground between the rubbish. He picks the baby up and tries to pass it to a woman with a carriage, that randomly passes by. Since the baby does not belong to her, she forces Charlie to take it back. Charlie does not know what to do with the baby, so he tries to put it back where he found it. Unfortunately, a policeman comes by so Charlie is not able to drop it in the lane. Ich tricks an old man into holding the baby and runs away. The man leaves the baby in the woman’s carriage, who is nor amused about it and thinks Charlie left it there. As he passes by the woman forces him to take the baby with him by calling for the policeman. Charlie is clueless about what to do with the baby, so he sits down on the sidewalk and while playing around he finds a letter, that says “please love and care for this orphan child”. Charlie is affected by the letter and decides to care for the baby.

This changes after he walks along a bin, where a person throws their rubbish into but hits him. After that he finally sees the orphan but does not know what to do with it. First of all, he looks at it and then picks it up. But then he does not seem like he knows what to do with it. In the background a woman with her own child in a pushchair appears and the man tries to put the baby into it. This woman does not accept his act and forces him to take back that child. So he takes it back and tries to put it back at the place where he found it and picked it up. Eventually a police officer is standing right behind him and so he has to take the baby again. While running away from the officer he comes across an older man to whom he hands the orphan. This old man takes the baby then, but does not know what to do with it either. While he walks with the baby in his arms he sees a woman with a pushchair, who is the same one where the first man tried to put the baby at, and puts it into it and leaves unwatched. In the next moment the first man comes across the street and the woman sees the baby with her baby again, so she shouts at him and causes therefore the man to take the baby back. So he has got the baby and does still not know what to do. After a short walk he sits down at the kerbside and hugs the baby. In this moment he finds a note, which says that this baby needs to be loved because it is an orphan. This causes that the man cuddles the baby and takes it with him, in the end.

There was nothing much left, so the boy, by the name of Tommy, had to be very creative and had to constantly come up with new ideas to keep himself busy and make his life as exciting as possible. His parents worked a lot, so his best companion was a dog, by the name of Pilot. Tommy and Pilot did everything together and eventhough Pilot wasn't able to articulate his feelings verbally, Tommy knew what he was thinking at all times.  <br/>  One morning they woke up to examine what they had caught the day before: a frog. Both studied this little creature in awe, for frogs were not easy to find these days. Yet, the frog managed to escape out of the Jar Tommy had put him in. He couldn't believe his eyes when he realised that once again it was only him and Pilot left alone. But what if something happened to him, tommy thought, and decided to go and look for him. They searched the entire house, the garden, under the bed...nothing. It didn't make sense to Tommy. Why would his new friend leave him and Pilot, when he has a better life here? They went out to the forest and started to search in bushes, behind and inside trees, yet they still couldn't find him. Altough Tommy wasn't the tallest boy, he had the courage to climb up big rocks and trees. That must be friendship, Pilot thaught, and continued to look for his new friend. <br/>  As Tommy was standing on the rock, a malicious animal came from behind and pushed him aggressively. It turned out to be a deer. Tommy had never seen these kinds of animals before. Since everything was not as it had been in the country, formerly known as the USA, these animals were hardly ever seen in the forest. Tommy and Pilot were scarred and didn't quite know what to do. They both managed to run away and hide for a while. While they were hiding, Tommy took the chance to examine the environment around him. Suddenly he jumped up and started to wave his hands in excitement. ""We found him, Pilot! Look! We found him!"" On the other side was the frog with his whole family waiting for Tommy and Pilot. Tommy and Pilot felt relieved. All those struggles to find their new best friends weren't for nothing.  <br/>  Tommy, Pilot and the Frog(-family) became close friends. Everyday they would visit each other and go on adventures. Altough Tommy's own family was hardly ever at home, he found a new family."

Thereupon the disgruntled vagabond pulls out a cigarette and starts smoking. Looking to his left he finds a crying new born lying next to a bin. Charlie looks around in order to find out where the baby came from. At that very second a mother pushing a pram passes him. Accordingly, Charlie supposes that the new born belongs to her and puts it in the pram. However, it turns out that the lady is not the baby's mother since she is beside herself with rage. So Charlie takes the baby back. In his desperation he lays the child back on the ground which is seen by a police officer. Again he picks up the new born and hands it to an old man walking down the lane. Charlie grasps his chance, runs off and hides himself. The old man, not knowing what to do, puts the baby back in the pram on the street. The unwitting and relieved Charlie continues his walk down the street and passes the aforesaid pram. The mother discovers the stranger's child, runs after him and hits him with her umbrella. The fight catches the police officer's attention and Charlie picks up the baby. He's sitting down on the pavement, thinking about how to get rid of the child when he finds a note, apparently written by the baby's mother. The note says to please love and care for the orphan which Charlie finally decides to do.

In doing so he suddenly sees a baby lying next to a trash bin. He looks around to find out where the baby could come from. He lifts the baby up and notices a woman pushing a pram. Chaplin considers the woman to be the baby's mother and therefore he follows her and puts the baby into the pram. There is another baby already in there, though. The woman gets mad and makes Chaplin leave and take the child with him. Chaplin tries to get rid of the baby and puts it next to the trash bin where he has found it. At the same time a police officer passes by and Chaplin lifts the baby up again. Then he passes the baby to an old man he meets in the streets, pretending to having to tie his shoe. He runs away and hides from the man. However, the old man cannot find Chaplin but sees a pram standing in front of a shop. There is another baby already in it and the man puts the baby into the pram next to the other child. When a woman leaves the shop it turns out to be the same pram which Chaplin has tried to put the baby into shortly before. Chaplin leaves his hiding place and passes the pram. The mother recognizes him, thinks he was the one who put the baby into the pram again, follows him and hits him with an umbrella. She tries to make him take the baby but he refuses until the police officer arrives whom Chaplin has met before. Chaplin takes the baby, leaves and sits down at a footpath. Next to him there is a drain and he considers whether to put the baby into it but he decides against this.When frisking the cloths the baby has been wrapped in he finds a piece of paper. The letter says that the baby was an orphan and begs the finder to love and take care of it. Chaplin smiles and cuddles the baby and leaves with the baby on his arms.

This attempt to rid himself of the baby fails and thus the protagonist even considers to simply return the baby to the backyard where he found it. However, a police officer watches him and so he gives it to another man who then himself places the unwanted baby in the woman's pram. She suspects the protagonist and accuses him in front of the officer, which results in the protagonist's flight.

After ligthing up a cigar he spots a baby on the ground. He picks it up just when a mother with a pram passes by and appears to be looking for something. Chaplin, in good intent, thinks the kid belongs to her and puts it into the pram, only to find out that the baby is not affiliated with the woman. He then picks it up once again but soon finds himself wanting to leave the baby behind. In order to to that he hands the baby a passer who, in turn, seeks to get rid of the unwanted ""gift"". He then, just like Chaplin, discovers the pram of the woman, to drop the kid off and walk away quickly. As Chaplin walks by the woman by accident, she beats him up and insits on him taking the baby with him. At the end Chaplin finds a note attached to the kid's clothes that asks for the finder to provide love and a good home for the baby which is an orphan."

The frog took his chance and jumped out of the glass in which he was captured. He wanted to go home to his family.  <br/>  The next day, Henry and Bob noticed that the frog was gone. Henry was really sad because it had took them over an hour to catch the frog. Henry decided to go to the forest after breakfast and see if he could find the frog somewhere.  <br/>  In the forest, they shouted the name of the frog (they had called him Luke) and searched for him even in trees, although they knew that it was not likely to find Luke in a tree. Henry wanted to find Luke so desperately that he climbed a very dangerous-looking rock to have a better view over the forest.  <br/>  Suddenly a stag came out of the bushes and pushed Henry and Bob into the river. Fortunately, there was a dead tree in the river so that they did not drown but could rescue themselves. <br/>   Sitting on the tree, they suddenly noticed a little frog family watching them. Henry saw that it was Luke with his wife and his six little children. Henry knew that this was the place where Luke belonged, not in the glass in his bedroom. Slowly, Henry and Bob turned away and waved the little family goodbye. Then they went home and Henry decided that he would only watch animals in their natural environment from now on.

When the boy climbled on a boulder, a big deer appeared behind it and caught the boy between his horns. Then, the deer pushed the boy down a small cliff, so the child and his pet were landing in a shallow lake. They tried to escape the water by climbing on a branch, where a family of frogs were hiding.

As he picks it up, he sees a Woman walking behind him with a buggy and comes to the conclusion, that the baby must be hers. But as he puts the baby next to the one, who is already occupying the buggy, the mother is telling him, that the baby he found isn't hers.

He proceeds to place the baby into the stroller when the woman becomes mad and demands for him to take it back out, which Chaplin does. He then puts the baby back where he found it just when a police officer walks by. Upon seeing the other man, Chaplin picks up the baby immediately and leaves. Walking around with the baby, he finds an old man whom he gives the baby under the impression of having to lace his shoes, when suddenly he runs away. The old man, certainly as unbothered by the small child, happens to run into the stroller of the woman as well, placing the baby into it then and walking away from the scene. Chaplin meanwhile unintentionally runs into the woman and the stroller again, who becomes mad at an instant and demands him to take out ""his"" baby. The police officer happens to stand close by. Realizing this, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. In the next scene, Chaplin sits down, looking defeated, the child in his arms. He finds a letter of a simple request: to take care of the orphan and to love it. Chaplin smiles at the child and walks off with it."

He seems to realize that he cannot abandon it, since it is alone. He takes the baby with him, trying to give it to other people, e.g. a mother with another baby or an old man. As nobody wants to take care of the child, he thinks about bringing it back to where he found it. A policeman sees what he is doing and forces him to take the baby with him. After that he is sitting on the street, probably thinking about what to do with the child. In that moment, he finds a piece of paper, hidden in the baby's blanket, which says that the baby is an orphan and that the finder should love it and take care of it.The man looks at the baby and takes it happily with him.

In the very same moment a woman walks by pushing a child's pushchair in front of her. He runs after her, however, before being able to reach her, the woman enters the building in the alley from which the items where thrown. Carles Chaplin then puts the baby into the pushchair. Meanwhile, the woman exits the house and observes Chaplin's action. Angrily, she approaches him, and the only thing that the recipient can see is a black screen with the words: ""Pardon me, you've dropped something"". The woman steams up and furiously says something that cannot be heard. Chaplin then almost takes the wrong baby out of the pushchair. However, he is reminded by the woman that he took the wrong human being. He puts it back, takes the baby that he found next to the barrels and walks away. The barrels is the place where he goes to next, to return the baby. A police man appears, stops with a stern look on his face and Charles Chaplin takes the small creature back into his arms and followingly he is seen in a different street. Here, another man with a walking aid can be perceived. Chaplin puts the baby into the man's arms and runs away. Carrying th baby, the man follows him. However, Chaplin manages to hide in a shed.

He takes it and immediately searches for someone to take over the baby. He puts the baby in a pram of another mother coming along saying he found something she had dropped. She feels offended and he has to take the baby back. With the attention of putting the baby back in the corner where he found it, he wanders off. Then, a policeman watches him and he takes the baby again.

He then tried to lay the Baby back in the streets but while doing so he was interupted by a police officer. Shortly after he met an old man, who he kindly asked to hold the Baby for a minute, and ran off. Unfortunetaly the old man passed the Lady with the other Baby again and put the Baby in her stroller.

It deals with the issue of responsibility. The protagonist Charlie suddenly finds a baby in an absent corner beside some bins. He takes the baby and tries to hand it to several other people which he meets on the streets. As he does not know to whom the baby belongs, he hands it to several other passer-bys. For instance, Charlie tries to put the baby into a baby buggy of a woman, who reacts impulsive and aggressive. She hands the baby straight back to him. To conclude, he does not know where to take the baby, for all his tries to get rid of the newborn failed. Therefore he sits down with it and finds a small letter. In this letter it is written that the writer of it could not take care of the baby and hopes that somebody would take care instead. By this, the short clip ended."

And they did not just see the frog that they kept in a glass at home. In fact, they saw a whole frog family. That was when Charlie knew that his frog escaped to see his family and that he was in a better place now. So Charlie and Speedy said goodbye to the frog family and left to go back home. They looked behind to wave and they saw the whole frog family sitting on the tree watching them leave."

Chaplin	written_online	30	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	In a rather trash-filled ally, were people do not care about the waste and trash they are throwing out of the window on the streets, the Tramp, played by actor Charles Chaplin is taking a walk. A few moments later he finds a little baby, wrapped in blankets laying on the ground in a little corner. Chaplin looks up to the balcony which causes for comedic effect. He seems to think that someone had thrown out their child, just like they are throwing out trash out of the balcony. He immediatly takes the baby and tries to find it's mother or father. He tries to find someone he can give the baby to. After seeing a woman with a stroller, he assumes that the baby belongs to the woman eventhough there was already a baby in the stroller. He carefully places the child in the stroller and tries to get out of the situation as politely as possible. He even says: ''you dropped something'' and is tipping his head, like he has done something admirable. But the woman is not accepting that child and gives the baby back to Chaplin. His second idea is to simply place the baby back to where he found it. On the street, right next to a trash can. This plan is quickly interrupted by the police officer passing by. He is not asking why Chaplin is trying to put the baby there, he simply gives him a look and Chaplin takes the baby and goes away. His third plan is to give the baby to a man he sees on the street. He told the man that he has to tie his shoe and as soon as the man takes the child, Chaplin runs away. The man, holding the baby in his arms sees the woman with the stroller and, like Chaplin just places the baby in the stroller and runs away. Chaplin is passing by that woman a moment later and she immediatly recognizes him and is furious. She even smacks him on his head and gives him back the baby. In that moment, the tramp was visibly desperate. He did not know what to do with the baby so he just sat on the sidewalk. Unwrapping the child a little bit, he discovers a note that says ''love this orphan child''. After that he gives the baby a little hug, gets up and goes his own way. He is not looking for anyone he can give the baby anymore. He is taking it with him.

He proceeds on his way smoking a cigarette when suddenly a pile of rubble falls down on him from above. Seemingly annoyed he looks for another cigarette as his previous one fell on the floor with the rubble. Before he starts to continue walking he spots a baby on the side of a building, he acts confused and it seems as he were looking for the child's parents. He then sees a woman walking by with a buggy. The woman leaves the buggy standing by the side of a building to go inside, Charles Chaplin uses the time to put the child he found in the buggy next to the woman's but she caught him in the act and asks him angrily to remove the second child from the buggy. He now looks for other ways to get rid of the child, at first, he tries to put it back where he found it but a policeman sees it, afterwards he hands it to another man he sees walking around. Said man now looks for a place for the child in Charles Chaplin's place, sees the woman's unattended buggy and places the child in it. Mr. Chaplin, now happy that he does no longer have to look after the child, walks past the building next to which the buggy still stands. The woman comes back to the buggy and sees the second, unwanted child. She wonders where it came from and sees Charles Chaplin. She runs after him and beats him up with her umbrella, forcing him to take back the child. Mr. Chaplin walks away with the child and sits down on the kerb. He sees a sewer next to him and thinks about dropping the child in it. He does not seem very convinced of this idea though, so he takes a closer look at the child. Doing that, he finds a letter saying, ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". The letter moves him and changes his attitude towards the child immediately, he starts to smile and walks away happily with the child in his arm."

One day Jackson and Chester went for a walk in the woods and they found a frog that seemed to be a little lonely. Jackson immediately fell in love with this little frog and decided to take him home. He named him Froggy. When Jackson came home he went straight into the kitchen , took a huge glas out of the cupboard and decided that this should be the place for Froggy to feel at home. Back in his room Jackson starred with such admiration at Froggy as if he had found a new best friend. And even his dog Chester got along with Froggy. But late at night when Jackson and Chester were asleep, Froggy climbed out of his new home and jumped right out of the window. The next morning when Jackson and Chester woke up they were really shocked to find no Froggy in their room. Jackson was really sad and missed Froggy so badly that he went out to search for Froggy in the woods. Of course, Chester was beside him, like always. When they finally arrived in the woods they called his name out loud. ""Froggy , Froggy !!! Where are you?"" . And even Chester helped Jackson to look for him. But Froggy was nowhere to find. When Jackson decided to climb onto a huge rock to get a better overview he must have overseen the deer that was behind it. He accidently held on to the deer, because he thought that it was a tree. That is when the deer got nervous and moved, which caused Jackson , and Chester who was behind him , to fall right over it and directly into the sea . Luckily they both know how to swim so they didn't panic. When they came out of the water they held on to a big fallen tree and felt safe rightaway. After they stood up and realised what just had happend and how unlucky they were they discovered Froggy . He sat behind the tree with his family. Froggy-wife and Froggy-children. This was the moment when Jackson realised what he had done and that he never thought about the fact that Froggy might have a family when he took him home. So he decided to go home with Chester and leave Froggy be alone with his family. He waved Froggy and his family goodbye and went for a walk with his old buddy Chester.Although he really misses Froggy he knew that it was for the best. And if they didn't die, they still all live happily ever after."

Otis was kept in a jar on the floor. On this certain day the little boy forgot to close the jar properly and Otis escaped the jar and then the whole house. When the little boy noticed that his green friend was gone he was shocked and decided to search for him in the park near his house. Butter and the little boy shouted after Otis and searched everywhere. In beeholes, on trees on stones. However, Otis was nowhere to be found. One of the stoneswhich the little boy climbed upon was so high that he had to grab the stitches of a near tree. At least that was he had thought. In fact, the stitches were part of a forest animal that pushed Butter and him into the lake. Luckily both of them were good swimmers and and it did not take them long to rescue themselves. They were absolutely suprised when they found Otis on the other side of the lake. By his side there was another frog and a bunch of tiny frog babies. So that was where Otis had run to! Empathetic as he was, the little boy congratulated Otis, and Butter and him left with a heartwarming farewell.

The boy found the frog the day before by a small pond in a forest nearby and now looks after him, accompanied by his dog. In the night, however, while the boy and his dog are sleeping peacefully, the frog manages to escape from his permanent new home and when the boy awakes in the morning to find the frog gone, he is very sad. As soon as he finds the frog missing, the boy goes outside with his dog to look for his lost little friend. The boy shouts after him, but the frog is nowhere to be seen. The boy and his dog start looking everywhere; in the trees, in the bushes, beneath sticks and rocks, but still, the little frog is nowhere to be found. After a while, the boy is till looking for the frog, beneath a large rock. All of a sudden, the boy is surprised by a huge deer who takes him and his dog up on his neck and carries them to a nearby pond. He throws the boy in who can barely manage to get out, holding on to a fallen tree. Fortunately, however, the boy is lucky and finds a frog family just beneath the fallen tree. When he discovers that there are a lot of little frogs, he is very happy and gladly takes one of them home with him, waving the frog family goodbye.

One day they caught a frog and put it inside a glass. They watched it all evening. It was very fascinating. When it was time to go to sleep, they both went to bed, while the frog was still inside the glass in front of the bed. In the night the frog crawled out of its glass. The next morning Timmy and Spencer woke up and were excited to play with the frog, but unfortunately they found an empty glass. Hence they immediately went outside to look for the missing frog. Timmy and Spencer went out into the woods, climbed onto trees and rocks, however they couldn't find the frog. As Timmy and Spencer climbed onto a rock, a deer suddenly appeared and shoved them into a little pond. Luckily they were able to swim and got out of the water. Thereupon they climbed onto a trunk of a tree. When they heard a sound that seemed to be the croaking of frogs, they looked behind the trunk. Surprisingly they discovered the frog and its family! Afterwards they all played together all day long and had lots of fun!

Chaplin	written_online	20	Outside classroom	Spellchecker	In the movie clip Charles Chaplin is on a stroll when he finds a crying baby lying on the floor of a lonely alleyway. Chaplin is confused and when in that very same moment a mother pushing a stroller passes him, he connects the dots and assumes that she dropped the baby. The woman is indignant and tells Chaplin to take the baby back when he puts it into the stroller with her own baby. He goes to put the baby back in the spot where he found it but a police officer catches him in the act. Chaplin flees the scene with the baby in his arms and catches a man walking when he turns the corner. He hands the baby over to him under the pretence of tying his shoes but then he promptly runs away, leaving the baby behind. In his quest to get rid of the baby, the man finds the stroller from Chaplin's previous encounter and puts the baby inside while the mother is nowhere to be found. In a fate of bad luck, Chaplin passes that very same stroller and the mother, who has now returned, assumes that Chaplin put the baby back inside. She drags him to the stroller and makes him take the baby back again with the help of the police officer. Chaplin, who considers throwing the baby into the sewer for a short moment, sits down and finds a letter between the cloth the baby is wrapped up in. The note begs the reader to “love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin seems to be touched by this and the music transitions into a happier melody when he finally smiles at the baby. The video ends with Chaplin leaving the scene with the baby in his arms.

He then lits himself a cigarette only to find a baby lying next to the trashcan. The man checks if there is anyone around whom the baby maybe belong to but hes not able to spot anyone until a woman with a baggy comes down the alley. With her having still space left in the baggy, the man assumes that the baby might belong to her and puts it in the baggy. The woman then refuses to take the baby, probably claiming its not her own.   While the man tries to bring the baby back to the place he found it, a police officer walks by and spots him  so the man stops his doing and continues walking. When he sees a man walking with a sick, he ask if he could hold the baby for him so he can tie his shoes. Being freed he rans off and leaves the baby and hides in the alley. The man with the stick tries to find him but instead discovers the abandoned baggy and places the baby inside. Meanwhile the man has to leave his cover because the police office is walking in his direction. He passes the baggy just when the Woman returns to her babby and notices the second baby. The woman rans after him and hits him with an Umbrella, and gets him to go back to the baggy but the man refuses to take the baby. But the woman sees the police officer walking down the streets and tries to make notice of the argument going on between her and the man. The man immediately picks up the baby and leaves the scene. He then sits down on the curb thinking about pushing the baby down the gutter but he doesnt. He spots a note claiming that the person who finds the baby hopefully loves and takes care for the baby.After a while he walks down the same alleyway he came from  still holding the baby.

At the end of the narrow way, he finds a lonely baby lying on the floor, presuming at first that the child mighthave also been thrown out of the window. He picks up the kid and tries to figure out where it came from. At first, he possibly thinks that it belongs to a woman with another child in her pram, so he lays the baby into that pram, which leads to the angry woman shouting furiously at Chaplin. He then wants to lay the baby back to where he'd found it, but, being watched by a policeman, picks it up again and takes it with him onto the street where he then gives the baby to an old man. Chaplin escapes quickly and the old man again wants to get rid off the baby by putting it into the same woman's pram as before. The woman, again presuming that Chaplin laid it in there, runs after him and punches him on the head with an umbrella. Exhausted, Chaplin takes the baby back and sits with it on the sidewalk, reading the letter that the baby carried with it which says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Chaplin apparently decides to do just that and walks away with the baby."

He is wearing a suit and a hat, carrying a walking stick. The second time a person dropped rubbish on Chaplin trough the window, he was angry and started coursing at this person saying: 'Awkward ass'. After this he lit up his cigarette and walked on. Suddenly, he found a crying baby so he picked it up and put it into the pram of a woman that just walked by saying to her: 'Pardon me, you dropped something.', which shows that he is being polite and slightly rude at the same time as he is assuming that the baby belongs to the woman. The woman complained so Chaplin took the baby again and put it back to where he found it. What he didn't realize was that he has been watched by a policeman so Chaplin had to take the baby into his arms again. When another man, who was older than Chaplin, passed by, Chaplin gave him the baby and ran away. This man put the baby back into the woman's pram which stood outside a store. When the woman came out of the store and discovered the second baby in her pram she was annoyed and started to get angry. Chaplin walked by her and she couldn't help herself but attacking him as well as showing him why she did so. The policeman walked by and the woman complained to him about Chaplin who ended up carrying the baby with him again. Sitting down in the edge of the sidewalk beside a drain, he was thinking about dropping the baby there but hesitated as it was most likely to be the child's death sentence. Then he found a letter in between the child's clothes, which he began to read. It said: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Chaplin put the piece of paper into his chestpocket and looked at the baby. In the end, he got up and walked away with the baby carried safely in his arms.

Suddenly bricks fell down on him from above, which turned his cigarette off. While lighting up a new cigarette, he discovers a baby beside a garbage can. He assumes that the baby belongs to a woman with a stroller, who walkes by in that moment. Consequently, he puts the baby inside the stroller but the woman gets angry and forces him to take the baby back. Afterwards, he tries to lay the baby back down beside the garbage can but a police officer happens to overlook the scene, forcing him to take the baby back into his arms. After noticing an elderly man walking by, he forcefully makes the man take the baby and walks away. The man coincidentelly discovers the same woman with the stroller from before and puts the baby into the stroller without the woman noticing. When Chaplin walks by again, the woman sees the baby in the stroller and angrily forces him to take the baby again under the watchfull eyes of the police officer. After shortly thinking about puting the baby into the drain channel, Chaplin gives up and discovers a letter inside the blanket in which the baby is wrapped up which notifies him that the baby is an orphan. Shortly after reading that Chaplin happily decides to keep the baby.

The obviously poverty stricken neighborhood is heavily littered and people have no shame throwing trash out of their windows. Mr. Chaplin is repeatedly hit by named trash. After his cigar is lost in one of the incidents, he stops to light a cigarette. It is at this moment that he realizes an infant laying on the ground. He picks the baby up and puts it in a stroller of a passerby. The Lady calls him out and Mr. Chaplin again has to take possession of the little one. He thinks about putting the baby back where he found it but is stopped by a police officer. In an attempt to ditch the infant he asks an older gentleman to hold the baby so he can tie his shoes. Mr. Chaplin takes advantage of the situation and runs away. The older gentleman then decides to put the infant in the stroller of the Lady who previously had called out Mr. Chaplin. The Lady who had parked the stroller in front of a store comes back out and sees Mr. Chaplin, who coincidentally happened to walk past store and hits him with an umbrella. And again, Mr. Chaplin has to take possession of the baby. Desperate and out of options Mr. Chaplin sits down holding the baby in his arms. He finds a note hidden in the babies clothing. The note says that the baby is an orphan who needs to be loved. Mr. Chaplin immediately falls in live with the little bugger and walks away happily.

The residents throw their rubbish out of the window and onto the street, hitting the strolling man in the process. The man loses his cigarette as a results and decides to fetch another one from his cigarette box and light it. At that moment he notices a baby, wrapped in cloth, lying on the pavement next to a bin. He picks it up and looks for the rightful owner. He sees a woman with a buggy passing by and decides to approach her. The man puts the baby in her buggy and tells her that she dropped something. Upon her infuriated reaction he takes the baby from the pram and puts it back on the pavement, where he found it earlier on. A police officer catches him in the act and the man picks the baby up again to avoid any trouble. On his now continued search for the respective parent he spots an old man with a long beard. The man walks up to the bearded pedestrian and asks him to hold the baby, so that he can tie his shoes. The old man takes the baby and our main character makes a quick getaway and hides. The bearded man chases after him but cannot catch up. He sees a buggy without an owner and inconspicuously lays the baby in it. The main character comes out of hiding and continues his way. Coincidentally he walks past that buggy at the same time the woman owning the buggy comes out of a building and notices the baby that does not belong to her. She sees the men from the beginning and concludes that he must have put it in the pram again. She chases after him and hits him with the umbrella she was carrying. They both argue with each other when the police officer from the beginning walks past them and notices the fuss. Just like earlier the man takes the baby to avoid any further conflict. He gives up his search and sits down on the pavement. He looks at a manhole next to, opens it, looks at the child and shortly considers throwing the child away. The man dismisses that thought and finds a note likely saying: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"" shortly after. After reading the note, the man looks at the child again but this time with a content and caring look. The scene ends with the man walking out of the picture."

They kept him in a jar and played with it all day long before they went to bed at night. While the little boy and his dog slept peacefully, the frog climbed out of his jar and jumped away. As soon as the sun rose, the dog and the boy woke up to see that their frog had run away the night before. They started looking for it everywhere and especially in the forest. The boy climbed up trees whereas the dog helped him search on the ground. They even climbed up big stones and hills and called for the frog but the only animal they found is a deer. The deer pushed the boy and his dog into a small lake but that did not stop the two of them from searching for their frog. Once again they climbed over things crossing their way until they finally found the frog with his family. They took their little frog home and waved his family goodbye.

He stops and opens a little box that seems to contain half-smocked cigares and cigarettes. In the following, the man uses a match to lighten a cigar, before starting to smoke it. All of his gestures are exaggerated, which adds to the all in all comedic feeling of the video.  <br/> Suddenly, he turns around and finds an infant, who is swaddled in a blanket beneath a trashcan. The man picks the baby up and looks around and up into the sky, seemingly wondering where the baby came from. He sees a woman with a baby in a stroller passing by and places the found infant in her stroller, telling her that she has dropped something. Meanwhile, the woman, starts shouting  and arguing. Devastated, the man takes the baby out of the stroller and the now angry woman walks of with her child. <br/> In the next scene, the man tries to lay the baby down next to the trashcan, where he has found it earlier, when a police officer passes by and sees it. Probably thinking the man just tries to get rid of his baby, he scolds him. The man leaves quickly with the baby.  <br/> In the following scene the man finds an old man, walking slowly with the help of a walking cane. He gestures at the eldery man to hold the baby, while he acts as if he is tying his shoe laces, before quickly running off.  <br/> The man, followed by the eldery man,  runs away and finally hides in a big container. The eldery man cannot find him and is left with the baby, until he sees another baby in a stroller in front of a store. He quickly drops of the baby and walks away. In this moment, the police officer is passing by.  <br/> When a woman exits the store it is visible that it is the same woman that appeared earlier in the clip. She sees the young man passing by and starts attacking him, thinking that he placed the baby into her stroller again.  <br/> The police officer notices the argument and stops by. After the women explained the situation the young man quickly picks up the baby again.  <br/>  <br/> Finally, he sits down with the baby in his arms. Underneath him, there is an utility hole. He debates throwing the baby away, when suddenly he finds a note in the baby's swaddle.

After that he decides to take out a cigar and shortly after that he notices a baby just lying on the ground, which he decides to pick up. Making a logic conclusion he puts the baby in a baby buggy of some unknown mother, thinking it is her missing child because the buggy is build for two babies. It turns out the woman is not the mother of the child and angrily returns it to Chaplin. Without any options left he puts the baby back to the place he found it, but is forces to take it back because a policeman spotted him doing so. Chaplin, not wanting to take care of a random baby he found, simply hands it over to some old man on the street and runs away. The old man is not able to find Chaplin, and by pure coincidence puts the child in the same buggy Chaplin tried earlier. The policemans presence forces Chaplin to take the same way the old man did making him walk past by the buggy. The woman notices him and beats him up with her umbrella. Unwillingly taking back the baby he is unsure what to do with it but after finding a note of the mother inside the blankets the baby is covered in, he decides to take care of the child.

On the left, next to a trashcan, he sees an infant and picks it up. In this moment, a woman with a stroller walks into frame and down the opposite side of the alley. The man notices her, follows her and tried to get her attention. When woman stops, the man places the infant inside of the stroller and talks to her. Apparently the infant does not belong to the woman, because she rejects it and returns it to the man. After that the man walks back the spot where he found the infant and lays it down. Just in that moment a police officer appears in the frame. The man notices the police officer and picks the infant back up and walks away. In the next shot, we see the man walking down a street and meeting another man. The first man gives the infant to the second man and runs away. The second man tries to pursue the first man, who at this point is hiding in a shack. When the second man fails to find the first man, he notices a stroller on the side of the street and lays the infant down in the stroller. After that, he runs away. In the next shot, the first man leaves the shack and meets the police officer once again and walks away. In another shot, a woman appears in the frame next to the stroller and sees the infant. In this moment the first man walks past her and she pursues him and knocks him down with an umbrella. She keeps hitting the man with the umbrella and forces him back to the stroller, where they start arguing. In the next shot, the police officer appears again and walks towards the man and the woman. After a short period of time, the man picks up the infant and walks away. After a while, the man stops and sits down on the sidewalk. While he is sitting there, he thinks about dropping the infant into a gutter, he quickly abandons that thought. In the next moment, he attempts to pet the infant, but the infant bites him. In the next moment, the man inspects the infant clothing and notices a note. The note reads ""Please liv and care for this orphew [sic!] child"". After reading the note, the man pets the infant again and walks away."

They had been on many adventures together but this evening they are looking at one very interesting finding. They found a big frog and managed to catch him using a glass jar. They took a close look at him before going to sleep but the frog managed to escaoe. After waking up the boy is quite surprised to see the empy jar and so he went out with his dog to find his frog again. They went out into the forest where they found him last day and searched for him everywhere. The dog used his nose to look for traces the frog might have left and the boy tried climbing on trees and rocks while loudly shouting out to the frog. However, a stag felt disturbed by all this noise so he grabbed the boy while he was standing on top of a rock and tossed him into the nearby waters using his big antlers. The boy and his dog managed to get out of the water by using a drifting log and swimming back to the land on it. Luckily for them, right there where they got the ground back on their feet they found the frog, happily standing next to his wife and his many children. The frog was very impressed by the many troubles they took onto themselves just to find him once again and even though he did not like being in captivity he was now convinced that also his children can learn a lot from the boy and his braveness so he offered one of his children to him. Maybe one day little frog jr. will return back to his father and be just as adventerous and brave as our boy and his dog following every step he makes

Chaplin is walking through the streets and tries to avoid the garbage that is thrown out of the windows. After he was showered with old vegetables from a window above, he wants to smoke a cigarette but a baby that is lying behind a garbage bin is stopping him. He searches for the mother and thinks that a woman with a baby stroller is the mother but soon he finds out that she’s not because she starts to argue with him, as soon as he places the infant into her carrier. Chaplin wants to put the baby back next to the garbage bin but a police officer catches him and he has to stick to the child. After that he  gives the baby to an old man pretending his shoelaces are open and running away. The old man places the baby into the baby carrier of the woman, who is not the mother, after chasing after Chaplin. Chaplin is caught by the same woman and they argue until she calls the police officer and Chaplin takes the baby back. Desperate, he sits on the road curb and thinks about dumping the baby into the sewer but he finds a letter attached to the baby, which says that the finder should care for this orphan baby. Chaplin seems touched by this and takes the baby with him.

Realizing he cannot leave the baby there he takes it and walks the streets carrying it in his arms. He then asks a man to hold the baby for a minute so he can tie his shoe. After the man took the child from him, Chaplin runs away and hides. The man tries to find him but fails. Thus, he places the baby in the buggy of the same lady Chaplin placed it in before. The lady discovers the child at the exact same moment Chaplin, who came out of his hideout, walks by. She recognizes him and hits him with her umbrella and makes him pick up the baby with help of the police officer. Chaplin then sits down on the curb and thinks about throwing the baby in the drain.

This discovery astonishes the protagonist: He looks around in an effort to determine the source of baby.  <br/> In the same moment, a woman with a pushchair enters the scene - she pushes her pushchair up the street the man just came down. The man discovers the pushchair and concludes that the woman must have dropped the baby. He thus carries the baby over to the the pushchair in order to bed the child into the pushchair. His deed, however, infuriates the woman as she denies to have dropped the baby. As result, the protagonist takes again the baby into his arms an walks back to place the baby next to the crash can where he originally discovered the baby.  <br/> Unfortunately, this situation is observed by a police man which just entered the scene. Afraid of the police officer, the protagonist takes the baby into his arm again and walks away. In a neighbouring street, the protagonist asks an old man to hold the baby for a few seconds as he pretends he has to tie his shoes. Instead of tying his shoes, however, he flees the scene and hides behind a door. The old man tries to pursue the protagonist but is to slow. However, he discovers the same pushchair the protagonist has discovered earlier and beds the baby in it.  <br/> When the woman returns to her pushchair, she observes immediately that the baby was placed again inside her pushchair. In the same moment, the protagonist passes her: She follows him and beats him down with her umbrella. The woman forces him to return to the pushchair and demands the removal of the additional child in it. The two discussing parties are joined by the police officer which eventually results in the man carrying the baby away. After a few meters, he sits down on the kerbstone. The protagonist briefly considers to throw the baby into a gully, but discards this option. The baby is then closer scrutinised by the protagonist. His examination reveals a note: ""Please love and care for this orphan child'. Finally, the protagonist seems to adopt the child and walks out of the scene."

In a corner, Charlie finds an abandoned child. When he sees a woman passing by pushing a pushchair, he concludes that she propably lost the baby or at least will know what to do with it. He calls her and puts the baby into the pushchair, but the woman protests and explains that he misinterpreted something. Charlie leaves with the child in his arms. Leaving it in the corner where he found it turns out to be a bad idea, as a policeman approaches and signals him to take care of the baby. Then an elderly man passes by. Charlie asks him to hold the child for him, pretending to lace his shoes. Instead, he runs away and hides. The elderly man notices the pushchair parked outside of a shop and leaves the baby there. In the meantime, Charlie leaves his hiding place. The approaching policeman blocks his way, so he turns and walks in the direction of the shop. Having passed by the pushchair, he gets stopped by the woman who left the shop and sees the baby in her pushchair. The starting dispute calls the policeman's attention. Charlie ends up with the baby in his arms. Desperate, he sits down, consideres shortly disposing of the baby in the gutters. Having a closer look at this unwanted bundle, he discoveres a piece of paper slipped into the clothes of the baby. It is a little letter, asking to love and to take care of the orphan. This warms Charlie's heart, and he finally accepts the baby as his responsability.

After that the man tries to get rid of the baby by placing it in the arms of an old man under false pretenses. He then quickly runs away. The old man also notices the baby carriage standing on the sidewalk, no parents in sight. He decides to leave the baby in it as well and walks off uncaught. Only a few seconds later the woman steps out onto the street in the exact same moment the protagonist walks by the carriage.

As he smokes a cig he discovers a baby lying on the ground beneath the trash cans, wrapped in rags. Assuming that its parents forgot it there, he starts to search for them. When a woman with a baby carriage walks by, he puts the findling in the carriage, but the woman gets worked up because it is not hers. Chaplin decides to put it back where he found it, but then an officer notices him, thinking that Chaplin is about to abandon his child. As that would turn him into a bad person, he has to find another place for the child. An old man is his next victim, he palms it off on him. The old man then again tracks down the same carriage and Chaplin, walking by finally free from the burden, is being made responsible as the woman recognizes him as she returns to the scene. Unfortunately, the officer is back again, so he needs to take back the baby. Pondering on the curb, he finds a note in the bundle, saying that the founder should take care of the orphan. Chaplin seems at peace with this wish and will do as he has been told.

He picks it up and tries to find out where it came from. A woman with a buggy then passes him and Chaplin thinks the newborn belongs to her. He tries to give it to her but she refuses. After that, he brings the baby back to the place in which he found it but he gets stopped by a police officer who witnesses Chaplin dropping the child next to the trash. He then tries to get rid of the baby by tricking an old man and running away, but that also fails, again because of the lady with the buggy. Exhausted, Chaplin sits on the curb and finds a letter which the newborn was carrying around. The letter gives Chaplin the information that the newborn is an orphan. In the end it looks like Chaplin is going to take care of the baby.

They went into the woods, calling out for the frog, which was nowhere in sight. They looked everywhere for him, even high up in the trees. When Jimmy climed a huge rock to look behind a giant bush, the bush somehow became alive and moved. It appeared to be a deer, that hid behind it. It pushed both, Jimmy and his dog, down an embankment, right into a little lake. They got out of it, completely wet. Then, right behind a fallen tree, they finally found the frog. Surprisingly, the frog sat there in the middle of what seemed to be his little family. Little Jimmy did not want to part him from his family, but the frog insisted they should take one of his babies, so they will remember him. And so they left, little Jimmy, his dog and the baby-frog, as they waved good-bye.

From an around four meter high window someone throws out his trash which nearly hits Chaplin. After hesitating for just a second, Chaplin proceeds on his way until he is hit by trash from another window further down the alleyway which knocks a cigarette out of his mouth. The text ""Awkward ass"" appears on the screen, as Chaplin looks above him and shortly after he searches his cigarette case for a new one. Chaplin pulls one out, sticks it in his mouth and then pulls out a match which he lights on his shoe. After taking the first hit of his cigarette, Chaplin notices a newborn to his left next to whats looks like a trashcan of some sort. He then inspects it for a couple of seconds and takes a look around him before picking the newborn up. A lady with a stroller walks past him and he shouts after her, before laying the baby into the stroller. Another text pops up, saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". Chaplin points at the baby as he walks away but the lady insists that the baby is not hers. After picking up the wrong child at first, Chaplin is corrected by the lady and picks up the baby he found earlier and leaves the now certainly angry lady. He returns the baby to the place he found it, not noticing the police officer standing behind him. Chaplin then turns around, notices the police officer and quickly picks the baby up again, walking around the corner where a man with visible physical problems walks down the street. The man is handed the baby by Chaplin under the excuse of tieing his shoelaces, before he quickly runs away. The old man tries to chase Chaplin, who quickly hid behind a corner. After a few seconds, the old man finds the same stroller Chaplin found before and lays the baby inside it. When coming out of his hiding place, Chaplin runs into the police officer and quickly turns around, running directly to the lady with the stroller. After ignoring her, she chases him and knocks him to the ground with an umbrella. She grabs him by his jacket and pulls him right back to her stroller, and after a few seconds of arguing over the baby the police officer joins them. Chaplin then picks the baby up again, drops his walking stick and sits down on the sidewalk. He then opens an manhole and thinks about dropping the baby inside it, but quickly comes to the decision not to do it. Shortly after, Chaplin finds a note in the sheets the baby is covered in, which says:""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Afterwards, he inspects and plays with the child for a brief moment, before standing up happily and taking the child with him."

Straight away they went out to search for it. They went into the fields and the forest, shouted its name and hoped for it to return. They wanted their new friend back and were scared something might have happened to him. They even climbed trees and searched in every possible spot. When the boy climbed a rock, suddenly, a deer appeared and threw him into a pond next to the rock the boy had climbed. The dog landed next to the boy in the pond. Completely soaked they managed to climb out of it, holding on to a tree that had fallen down. When they took a breath on that tree stem they noticed something: There it was, the frog they had been searching for for the whole time. It was there with its wife and a few kids.

After an exciting day in the forest, Tim and his dog Struppi sat at the end of the bed in Tim's room and inspected their earlier find: a little frog, who was now sitting, not moving, in the glass jar Tim had put him into. As that got boring pretty quickly, Tim and Struppi decided to call it a night and go to bed. What they did not expect was, that the frog had just waited for this to happened and regained his strength and climbed out of the jar. When Tim and Struppi saw the empty jar in the morning, they could not believe it and decided to go search for their friend in the forest, where they had foud the frog the day before. <br/>  They searched everywhere, Tim climbed every tree in the area to get a better view and Struppi got himself into trouble with a bee hive, when trying to find the frog around it. Tim also climbed rocks, which his mum had always told him not to, since they can be pretty slippery, but that was not the problem... He held onto what he thought was a branch of a bush, but suddenly this branch started moving and he got picked up by a deer that had rested behind the rock. It gave Tim a good push and he fell down a little cliff, accompanied by his true friend Struppi.  <br/>  Both landed in the little pond below and got a big fright. They draged themselves out of the water and on to a dead tree stem, where they let out many coughs and took a couple of deep breath, before they were able to climb on top of the stem and look around. They could not believe what they saw: it was the frog family they found the day before and one of the frogs jumped towards Tim and Struppi straight away. That must be their friend, they thought, and since both sides seemed equally happy to be reunited, the rest of the frog family did not mind their fellow leaving with his friends. <br/>  Tim carried the frog on his hand, since he did not bring he jar, and with his other hand he waved good bye to the rest of the frog family.

In the morning when the boy realised the frog was gone he went out with his dog into the nearby woods. The boy and his dog searched in empty woodholes and beehives. They even went to look for him on top of a rock and in bushes. In one of the bushes was a deer hidden and the deer heaved the boy up with his antlers and threw him into a small lake, which was more of a big puddle really. They boy then climbed out of the lake with the help of an empthy woodtrunk and behind it he found his frog together with a whole gathering of other frogs. He picked up his little frog friend, waved goodbye to the other frogs and the three made their way home.

Whilst he is having a smoke break he finds an infant abandoned next to him. He presumes that the child must come from a mother that's passing by and pushing around a large trolly with another infant. It turns out that the infant is not hers and she send the man away furious with the accusation that she would forget a child on the side of the road. The man returns to the spot where he found the child and tries to just abandon it there again, but a police officer is watching him closely. So our protagonist moves onward with the child and sees some man walking along the road. Promply he attempts to get rid of the responsibility by pretending to need to tie his shoelaces so he would hold the baby but instead he runs away and escapes before the second man can catch up. The second man is now tasked with the infant and discovers the trolley of the aforementioned mother and he puts the child in the trolley when she is not paying attention and flees the scene. The Woman returns and is furious to find the child once again in her trolley as our protagonist happens to pass by she wails on him with her umbrella and makes him take back the child he briefly got rid of. Defeated our protagonist takes a rest on the sidewalk. As he does he finds a slip of paper tugged away in the rags of the infant. On the paper it is written that the child is an orphan and the plea to care for it. The protagonist gets up with the child and moves somewhere unknown as the film ends.

A window opens and somebody throws several pieces of garbage out, missing Chaplin every time. Chaplin keeps strolling, not noticing anything. Another window opens, somebody throws out a big amount of garbage, apparently aiming at the trash can standing underneath the window. The garbage lands on Chaplin instead. He's startled and apparently feels awkward, so he takes off his gloves and lights himself a cigarette. Not wanting to put his gloves back on, he throws them into the trash can and leaves. At the corner of the street he finds a baby lying on the ground, crying. He picks it up, gazes at the houses surrounding him. Just at that moment a mother with a child in a stroller walks by and enters a house, leaving the stroller in front of the open door. Chaplin puts the baby into the stroller when the mother comes back. She seems furious, aggressively asks him to take the baby back. Chaplin grabs the baby, they both leave in opposite directions. Chaplin goes back to the corner where he found the baby, puts it on the ground. At that moment, a police officer walks by and witnesses Chaplin leaving the baby. Chaplin attempts to leave the place, turns around, sees the police officer, picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. An old man with a walking stick walks down a street, Chaplin is approaching from behind. He pretends that he needs to tie his shoe, gives the baby to the man, then runs away, hiding behind a corner. The old man runs after him. When he can't find him, he notices a stroller standing in front of a house. He puts the baby into the stroller and leaves. Moments later, when Chaplin accidentally walks by, the mother comes out of the house, seeing an additional baby in the stroller and Chaplin walking by. She gets furious again, runs after him and beats him with her umbrella. They argue over the baby in the stroller, when the police officer walks by. The woman gesticulates wildly. Chaplin picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. Chaplin sits down on the pavement, a gully next to him. He opens it, pparently thinking about dropping the baby down the gully. He discards the idea and examines the babie's clothes instead, finding a note. The note says ""Please love and care for this orphaned child"". Chaplin looks at the babie's face, smiles, gets up and leaves with the baby."

He picks up the baby and is convinced that he has found the mother when he sees a woman with a buggy walking by. Indicating that it is not her baby, the woman refuses to take the child. The protagonist puts the baby down on the ground and apparently wants to walk off when a police officer enters the scene whereupon the protagonist changes his mind and picks up the baby again. In an attempt to solve the situation, the protagonist hands the baby over to a stranger in the streets and runs off. Irritated, the stranger tries to chase the protagonist but as he is not able to find him he puts the baby in a buggy of a woman, who, by conincidence, is the same woman from the scene in the beginning. When she sees the protagonist passing by, she runs after him and hits him with her umbrella, obviously convinced that he again had put the baby in the buggy. In the final scene of the video, after comtemplating to drop the baby in the sewerage, the protagonist finds a note on the baby saying that the child is an orphan that needs love and caring. The protagonist seems to changes his mind and walks off with the baby and a smile on his face.

At one point, however, they could not help themselves but become tired and eventually go to bed, to dream about what they would all do together come morning. <br/>  As soon as the sun was up, Timmy and Pyp woke up, but when they checked upon Higgins, they were terribly shocked to see that he had disappeared in the middle of the night. So they braced themselves for another adventure and went out into the woods, trying to find Higgins.  <br/>  They called his name and searched everywhere.They climbed on trees and rocks. Suddenly, a big reindeer appeared out of the blue, took Timmy on its horns and threw him and Pyp over a tiny cliff into a pond. They were all soaking wet, but no matter how much reason they had to be upset about this unexpected encounter, they turned out thankful. When they looked behind big fallen tree trunk, they finally found Higgins. <br/>  But this was not the end of the story: They realised that Higgins had a wife and many little children and felt horribly sorry for having taken him away from his loved ones the other day. So they apologised, and happily said goodbye to Higgins and his family, promising to pay them a visit on their next adventure.

After lighting his cigar he sees a baby laying between the garbage cans nearby. Willing to get rid of the child he tries to put it in a stroller of a strange woman, who, however is chasing him away. An attempt to put the baby back to where he found it is interrupted by a policeman and fails, so that the man then tries to trick a passerby into taking care of the child. The passerby however then puts the baby in the stroller in which it was previously laid and leaves. When the woman recognizes this she places the baby in the care of the first man to be introduced, who is unfortunately passing her, with the help of the policeman. The man sits down on the pavement and finds a letter inside the baby's clothes, informing him that the baby is orphaned. Upon getting to know this the man seems touched and rocks the child lovingly.

What follows is his struggle to find someone to take care of the baby: First of all he tries to hand the baby to a woman passing by with a pram. However, she angrily refuses to take it. That's why he sees no other possibilty than putting the baby back to where he initially found it, but as a police officer enters the scene, Choplin has to leave with the baby. In his following attempts to find someone else to look after the little kid, he puts it in the arms of a random stranger and then runs away. This elder man, now being in the same situation as Choplin before, also discovers the pram and decides to put the baby in there. The woman, just leaving the neighbouring building, finds the baby again in her pram. As Choplin coincidentally passes by, she assumes it was him who left the baby there.

Chaplin	written_online	40	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (German/English)	In the video you can see Charlie Chaplin casually walking down a street, smoking a cigarette. Almost being hit by an object which appears to be a brick, that a lady has thrown out of a window located right above his head, he has to take a step to the side. He keeps on walking and only a few seconds later he actually does get hit by another item that has been thrown out of the window. It is not easy to tell what the aforementioned object is but it looks like a bundle of branches and leaves. A little text pops up saying 'awkward ass'. Chaplin looks up to the window and then takes a box of cigarettes and cigars out of his jacket's inside pocket. He eventually takes out a cigarette and lights it after having taken off his leather gloves. He discards the taken off gloves and he discovers a baby lying in the corner of the street, wrapped in a blanket, screaming. Chaplin looks up in confusion assuming that the baby has been dropped out of a window as well and he picks it up. With the baby in his arms he struts to a lady's pushchair, which already has one child in it, and he carefully puts the new found infant in it too. Another text pops up saying 'Pardon me! You dropped something'. The woman, who did not see Chaplin at first, now spots him and furiously starts an argument. As a consequence, Chaplin now takes back the child and attempts to put it back to the place where he found it in the first place. However, this was prevented by a policeman looking at him strictly. Chaplin gives him an apologising look and picks up the baby again. He marches around the corner with the baby in his hands and sees an old man with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the man to hold the baby so that he could tie his shoelaces. He bends down but when the man did not look, Chaplin hurries away with the old man following him. Having lost sight of Chaplin, the elderly man finds the pushchair and places the baby in it, just like Chaplin attempted to do it earlier in the video. Leaving his hiding place, Chaplin encounters the police officer again and changes his direction to not have to pass him. Now the woman sees the second baby lying in the pushchair again and looks around trying to find the person being guilty of this. Coincidentally Chaplin walks past the lady in this exact moment and the women, recognising Chaplin from the earlier incident, knocks him down with her umbrella. After a heated discussion between these two, the police officer joins them but he remains silent. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and sits down with it on the pavement. He thinks about throwing the baby into the sewers but then reconsiders. In the end he finds a note that has been attached to the baby's blanket saying 'please love and care for this orphan child'. Looking at the baby's complexion, he smiles and leaves taking the baby with him.

Unidentifiable materials are being thrown out of the windows of the houses on both sides of the alley causing Chaplinˋs mood to darken. As he comes to a stop lighting himself a cigarette, Chaplin sees a baby wrapped in blankets lying on the ground. He picks it up carefully and decides to place it in a baby carriage of a woman standing nearby. As he makes an attempt to do so, telling the woman that she dropped something, the woman gets angry. Chaplin picks the baby up reluctantly and puts it exactly in the same place he found it. A police officer approaching behind Chaplin causes him to pick the baby up once more. On his way through the alleys he gives the foundling to an old man quickly running away. By chance, the old man places the baby in the same baby carriage in which Chaplin had already put it. As the owner comes out of the shop before which the baby carriage had stood unobserved, she sees the baby. Chaplin who walks by that moment is persuaded by the woman and the approaching police officer to take the baby with him a last time. Defeated in his trys to hand over the baby to someone else Chaplin sits down on the sidewalk. A short moment he thinks about putting the baby into the drain. Followed by his decision not to do so, Chaplin finds a note hidden in the babyˋs blankets asking the finder to care for the orphan child. Chaplin walks away cradling the baby gently.

After a few meters he eventually gets hits by trash and starts to complain. Afterwards he lights a cigarette to calm down and starts to notice a baby which is laying near some trash bins. He picks the baby up and wrongly assumes that it belongs to a passing woman who has a stroller. After putting the baby in the stroller, the woman complains and Charles picks the baby up again. The moment he put the baby back to where he found it, a police officer notices him. Out of guilt Charles picks up the baby again immediately. Under the excuse of having to tie his shoe, he gets an old man to hold the baby but runs away shortly after. The old man is following him angrily but lost him and notices a nearby standing stroller. He puts the baby inside and leaves. Charles left his hiding spot and was forced to move into the same direction as the old man was previously because of a nearby police officer. As Charles passes the stroller, the woman, which he angered earlier, comes out and notices the baby. She assumes that Charles put it inside her stroller again and hits him with her umbrella. This draws the attention of a police officer which forces Charles to take the child again. He walks down the road and ends up sitting on the side of the pavement. Shortly after he finds a small piece of paper in the clothes of the child which states that the child is an orphan and that he should be loved and taken care of. Charles ends up smiling and walks into the distance with the baby.

When waking up, Timmy was shocked to find out that the frog was gone, so he decided to go and look for him outside. He and Butcher spent almost the whole day wandering in the forest, climbing up trees and rocks, shouting (and barking) all the way. But the frog was nowhere to be found. Instead Timmy stumbled over a deer with majestic horns when he climbed up a pretty stone. The deer, not happy with a little, stupid boy on his head, got angry and threw Timmy and Butcher into a lake. Both boy and dog were soaking wet when they came out of the water. Exhausted, Timmy lay down flat on his belly over a tree trunk - and, miracles happen, this is were he found the escaped prisoner. The frog, he now learned, had a family. Upon realizing what this meant, Timmy decided to leave the frog in the depths of the forest and made his way home.

He then stops to light a cigar and notices a crying baby next to trash bin, first checking if someone is visible who might have thrown it in the trash from the windows like the trash that was thrown at him. He sees nothing, but then a woman with a baby stroller walks by and, assuming it must be hers, he places the baby he found in the stroller with the baby that is already in there. When the woman sees this, she gets angry at him and tells him to take the baby back, angrily walking away with her baby after he does so. After this, the man tries to place the baby back next to the bin where he found it but a policeman sees this and makes him take the baby back again. Following this incident, he sees an elderly man walking on a cane and tricks him into taking the baby, running away immediately when he does so. The elderly man also happens upon the stroller of the woman from earlier and also places the baby in it with the other baby, but again the woman sees this and gets angry, but at the younger man who placed it there earlier since he happens to be walking by at that moment. With the help of the policeman from before, she makes the younger man take the baby back again. The man then sits down on a sidewalk with the baby, not seeming to know what to do, when he finds a note in the babys blankets that states that the baby is an orphan and asks for someone to love and care for the baby.

He assumes the baby was lost by a woman who walks past him with a baby carriage. His attempt to return the child is futile however, as the woman vehemently states that this is not her child. Afterwards he tries to get rid of the baby. He wants to leave the child in the alley, but is stopped by a police officer. His next attempt appears succesful at first. Chaplin hands the baby to an elderly man before quickly running away.  However, the elderly man proceeds to do exactly what Chaplin tried at first. He puts the baby in the baby carriage of the woman we saw earlier. She notices this when Chaplin walks past her, assuming this was his doing. She beats him up und returns the baby to him. Annoyed, he sits down on the sidewalk, where he is tempted to throw the baby into the drain for a second. He hesitates and finds a letter under the childs wrap. It states that the baby is an orphan and asks for someone to love and care for the child. This moves Chaplin and he takes the baby with him with a smile on his face.

The main protagonist is shown walking along a small alley minding his own business, when a series of events unfolds. People are throwing garbage (?) out of their windows, while trying to aim for trash cans but missing them and almost hitting the main protagonist. Soon after that he pulls a box of cigarettes out of his jacket and starts to smoke. While he smokes he realises there is a baby lying on the street right next to him. Curiously he is looking for the parents or someone who might have dropped the baby there but cannot seem to find someone on the first look. However, when he turns around he spots a woman with a stroller and walks towards her. She disappears into a house and he puts the baby into the stroller, supposing she is the mother. The woman appears again and they start to argue, which implies she is not the mother. After almost taking her child, the protagonist picks up the child he found on the street. He then returns to the spot he found the baby in and is placing it there the way he stumbled upon it. When he turns around, there is a police officer standing in front of him, which leads to the protagonist promptly picking up the baby again, because of the implications.  He then walks away and as he passes another man, he pretends he needs to clean his shoes and signals the other man to hold the baby for a second, because he needs both hands in order to clean his footwear. As soon as the other man is holding the baby, the protagonis makes a run for it and hides somewhere in the previously shown alley. While looking for the protagonist, the second man comes across the same stroller shown before, getting the same idea as the protagonist and placing the baby in the woman's stroller. This time the woman does not realise that immediately as she is not present during this event. The moment she appears again and sees the second baby, the protagonist walks by her which leads her to running after him and hitting him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby again. He then sits down on a pavement and contemplates dropping the baby in the sewer. He takes a closer look at the baby and inside the blankets covering the baby, there is a letter with the words ""Please love and care for this orphan child."". This immediately changes the protagonist's stance towards the child as he realises the parents are not around anymore to raise the baby and he feels responsible for it now and walks away as a newfound father."

Due to residents tossing their trash out of the window he almost gets hit by trash twice until eventually the third hit scores.  <br/> He looses his cigarette, takes out a new one and ignights it, ready to keep walking. <br/> But behind a barrel he finds a crying baby bundled up in rags. After looking around for someone close who might have placed the baby there, Chaplin picks it up and places it in the stroller of a mother passing by, claiming she 'dropped' the baby. The mother protests since there's already a baby in her stroller and the found one isn't hers. Chaplin hastily picks the baby up again and wants to put it back where he found it but a policeman spots him doing so, which caused Chaplin to pick the baby up again and walk out of the alley. <br/>  <br/> In passing he meets an old man with a crutch, pretends his shoelaces are undone and asks the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoelaces again. But the moment the old man focusses on the baby Chaplin runs off, hiding in the alley. <br/> The old man can't find Chaplin but spots the stroller from earlier in front of a shop in which he puts the baby before he walks off. <br/>  <br/> Eventually the mother comes back out of the shop and notices the foreign baby in her stroller. Coincidentally Chaplin passes by again and the mother thinks he put the baby in her stroller again. She runs after him, smacks him with her umbrella and drags him back to the stroller, fighting with him over the baby. Only when a policeman takes notice of the turmoil Chaplin hastily grabs the baby and rushes off. <br/>  <br/> They sit down on the sidewalk close to a drain. And for a moment Chaplin considers putting the baby in there but decides against it. He shrugs at the baby and takes a closer look at the rags covering it as he notices a piece of paper, asking the finder of the baby to take care of the orphan.  <br/>  <br/> In the end Chaplin takes the baby with him with a smile.

After the dog and the little boy went to sleep, the frog climbed out of his jar and left. In the morning, after the boy and the dog woke up, they noticed that their friend was gone. Unsurprisingly, they were very worried about the little frog. As a result, they both started looking for the frog in the forest. They shouted his name at the top of their lungs and looked in every place they could think of. Doing so, the little boy climbed on a rock and held on to what appeared to be a stick of a tree, not paying attention to whom this stick really belonged - a deer. The deer picked the little boy up and then threw him and his dog down a cliff. However, this cliff was not very high and both landed unharmed in a lake. Being in the lake, they heard a noise which sounded very familiar - it reminded them of their pet frog. Following the direction of the noise, the little boy and the do looked behind a huge dead tree. To their suprise, they found their frog surrounded by a couple of other frogs. Realizing that their friend would be happier around his family, the little boy and the dog left the frog in the forest.

He is now standing in a small segment of the street with garbage cans surrounding him. The camera zooms in for a close-up as he goes on to opening a metal cigar case and extracting a white cigar. He rids himself of his gloves and lights his cigar. His gaze wanders and he spotts a crying baby behind one of the bins.  He picks the baby up and looks around. A women with a baby stroller hurries through the background, leaves the stroller unattended while shopping. He then places the baby in the stroller, however she returns prematurely and interupts him. He tries to put the baby back in the corner, yet a police officer arrives and dissuedes him from proceeding. Cut. The same man with the baby apears in a different alley and hands the baby over to a strange old man, who has  an obvious walking issue and runs away. The man with the walking issue again places the baby in the stroller of the previous lady and dissapears into thin air. The cigar guy walks past and the woman goes after him as she assumes, he is the one responsiple for placing the baby in her stroller again. As they argue the police officer reappears on set and the cigar guy gives in and takes the baby with him. The cigar guy sits down next to a drain and considers his further actions. He even thiks about throwing the baby into the sewer system, but reevaluates that thought. Between the sheets of fabric in which the baby is wrapped up he finds a paper on which is written: Please care for this orphan child.

An unseen person tosses trash out of the window, not minding the passersby underneath. When he eventually passes the window, he plays around with his walking stick before he is hit with more trash from another window. As it is a silent movie, the spoken text is shown in title cards, the first one says ""Awkward ass."" The man looks at the trash, the up towards the window and takes out a small box filled with cigars. To light one of them, he takes off his gloves and lights a match on the heel of his shoe. Then he throws his gloves away.  <br/> As he turns to the side, a baby is shown lying on the ground, seemingly abandoned. The man looks at the baby, then around as if he was searching for somebody responsible. When nobody is seen, he picks up the child. In the background, a woman appears from the left, pushing a stroller. The man attempts to get her attention and ends up following her to what seems to be her house. The stroller, which she left outside, is occupied by another child, older than the discovered baby, but the man wants to put the younger kid down nonetheless. When the woman re-appears, she is shocked, so the man tries to explain the situation by saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something."" The woman does not seem to be happy about it and is shown yelling at the man, clearly indicating that this is not her child, so the man takes it with him once again. The woman storms off. <br/> Carrying the child back to the alley where he found it, the man wants to leave it there to be found by somebody else, but a police officers sees him doing it. When the man notices the officer, he promptly turns around once more, picks up the baby once more and leaves to the right side of the screen. <br/> A new alley is shown, with another man already walking along. The man walks up to him, stops, pretends that he has to tie his show laces and proceeds to hand him the child. He then runs off, leaving the baby to the stranger, but the new man follows. As the first man hides in a garage, the other one is looking for him, only to discover the stroller from before, still occupied by the other child. He puts the baby down, this time without the appearance of the mother. The man from the beginning, now child-less, dares to leave his hideout, only to run into the police man once more, so he quickly turns the other way. <br/> Meanwhile, the mother is shown, returning to her child where she finds the baby alongside it. However, as the man who actually placed it there has already left and the other man just happens to pass the stroller, she accuses him of leaving his child there. The accusation happens in the form of chasing him and hitting him with an umbrella, which causes the man to fall. She drags him back to the stroller, still hitting him as she does so. The police man comes out of an alley and notices the racket. The woman, still furious, explains the situation to him, which the man doesn't try to argue, so he only takes the baby and leaves the scene. As do the officer and the woman. <br/> In the next cut, the man standing on an empty sidewalk in front of a gutter. He sits down on the ground and opens said gutter. For a moment, he looks at the child, but then closes it again and only readjust his grip on the lump in his arms. for the first time, he looks at it more closely and discovers a small scrap of paper hidden in the folds of the blanket that is draped around the baby. ""Please love and care for this orphan child,"" is written on the paper. The man puts the paper away and looks at the baby again, smiling this time. In the last shot, he leaves to the end of the scenery."

He wears a suit, a hat and gloves. Due to getting hit by trash, the man lights up a cigarette. Next to a trash can he finds a newborn baby. After he realizes that there is no one near who the baby belongs to, he picks up the baby. When a woman with a baby stroller walks by, the man with the hat thinks that the baby belongs to her and then puts the into the stroller. The woman reacts angry and he takes the baby back. In a different street he passes by an elderly-looking man. He pretends that he has to lace his shoe and gives the baby in the arms of the elderly-looking man and runs away. The elderly-looking man is then hurrying behind him, but looses him in the courtyard. Due to the fact that he cannot find the man with the hat, he puts the baby in the stroller of the women, who has parked her stroller outside of a shop. She notices the baby in her stroller and coincidently meets the man with the hat whom she recognizes from before. After hitting him with an umbrella she tries to get him to take back the baby. When an officer is walking by, the man with the hat is giving up his defense and takes the baby back. He sits down at the sidewalk and takes a closer look at the baby. Inside the blanket he finds a letter, which says ""Please love and care for this orphaned baby"". The man with the hat gets up again and decides to take the baby with him."

Suddenly, after lighting a cigarette, Charlie finds a baby at the side of the road. After some confusion, he decides to put it in the pushchair of a women, assuming she 'dropped' the baby. But she didn't and makes him take it back. Charlie's next idea is to just put it back where he found it, but a policeman catches him in the act, which makes Charlie take it back into his arms and walk off. Fooling an old man, he then manages to leave the baby in said man's arms, hiding from him until he thinks it's safe to come out. The old man has the same idea as Charlie originally and drops the baby in the pushchair. Upon leaving his hiding spot, he encounters the policeman again This makes him change directions quickly. By chance, he walks past the women and her pushchair again, thus making her believe he dropped the baby in there and so she beats him with her umbrella. The policeman makes another appearance and Charlie is yet again forced to take back the baby. Dropping his cane on the sidewalk, he sits down on the curb to retrieve it. He is wondering for a moment whether he should drop the baby down the drain, but quickly decides against it. Instead, he finds a piece of paper with the words ""please love and care for this orphan child"" written on it. This seems to make him sentimental.

He is startled and pauses to light a cigarette. He then finds a baby on the street that he tries to give to a women passing by with a buggy, assuming that it belongs to her. She seems to tell him that it’s not her child and Chaplin takes the baby back, trying to put it back where he found it. However, a police officer sees him and gives him a stern look which leads to Chaplin keeping the baby and quickly giving it to another man out of the officer’s sight. The man drops the baby into an unsupervised buggy which turns out to be the one belonging to the women we saw earlier. She sees Chaplin pass by, assumes that he put the baby there again and chases him with an umbrella, beating him with it. She and the officer then force Chaplin to take back the baby. Chaplin sits down at the side of the street with it and briefly seems to consider dropping it into a drain next to him. He then shrugs and finds a note attached to the blanket the baby is wrapped in that reads „please love and care for the orphan child“. Finally, he smiles at the baby and leaves, still holding it in his arms.

Charly continues walking towards the viewer, smoking a cigarette when another incident like this extinguishes his cigarette. He insults the person responsible as an awkward ass and then proceeds to look for a new cigarette in his cigar box. Once he finds one he taps it onto the lid and then puts it in his mouth while getting a match from the pocket of his vest that he lights at the bottom of his shoe and then tosses into the near garbage bin. After that he also tosses his gloves.  <br/> He looks around and sees an abandoned infant wrapped in blankets lying on the ground next to the garbage bins. He looks around as to find out if one of the people from the upper stories know anything about said child. As he picks it up a woman with a pram walks by in the background. Charly follows her and as she enters a building and leaves the pram with her own child unattended he places the infant in it and attempts to walk away. However, she reacts quite furiously and tells him to take out the baby and then proceeds to walk off in the other direction.  <br/> Charly though places the infant back on the ground where he first found him only to realize that there is a police officer standing right behind him.

At some point they had encountered a frog and managed to capture him in a large jar. Now it was getting dark and Mark sat in his room, contemplating the frog with curiosity. Soon he became tired and went to sleep. However, when he woke up the next morning, the jar was empty. Left unguarded, the frog had managed to escape at night. Mark was sad that the frog had abandoned him, since he only wanted to become friends with him. So, in order to find his friend, Mark and the dog went back out into the fields and started calling out to the frog. They looked in the fields, and in the forest. Finally, and near desperation, Mark climbed onto a huge rock and once more shouted for the frog. He did not receive an answer, but suddenly a deer broke through the trees and pushed both Mark and the dog off a cliff. Screaming, they fell into a pond, wwhich they had overseen before. As both were good swimmers they managed to climb out of the water without difficulties. While they were catching their breath, Mark suddenly caught sight of the very frog they had been looking for all the way. And he wasn't alone: Mark realised that the frog he had captured so selflessly had, in fact, a family. When he realised this, Mark decided it was better to leave the frogs in the forest, where they belonged. He waved goodbye and, along with the dog, started the journey back home.

He takes out his walking stick and bends it a few times in his hands. While he is momentarily distracted, he gets hit by something that was being thrown out of a window, which causes him to drop his cigar. He then proceeds to take out his box of cigars and, after taking off his gloves, lightens another one with the sole of his shoe. After that he throws his gloves in a trash can. That is when he spots an abandoned baby lying behind another trash can. He picks it up and looks around to see who it might belong to and spots a woman with a pram. He hurries over to her and puts the baby in her pram. She gets angry and makes him understand that it isn't hers. He takes the baby out of the pram again and she scuttles away. He walks back to where he found the baby and puts it back down behind the trash can. However, when he realises that a police officer saw him doing so, he picks it back up and hurries away. Then he walks past an elderly man with a walking stick and tricks him into holding the baby while he pretends to tie his shoelaces and runs away. The elderly man hurries after him but can't find him. Instead, he sees a pram with another baby already in it, proceeds to put the baby in it, too, and walks away unnoticed. It turns out, the pram belongs to the woman from earlier, who recognises the baby. By chance, the protagonist walks past her in that moment, not noticing her or the baby. She runs after him and proceeds to beat him with her umbrella while dragging him back to the pram in order for him to take the baby back. The commotion attracts the police officer from earlier causing him to take the baby back and hurry away. Resigned, he sits down on the kerbside and holds the baby in his arm.

Suddenly, he finds a crying baby on the dirty floor, bundled up in blankets. He looks around, wondering where it came from. He then picks it up and sees a lady with a baby carriage with another baby in it, walking by.

But then a police officer comes walking by, so Charlie is forced to pick the baby back up. He walks around a corner where he sees an older man with a walking stick. Charlie hands him the baby, quickly runs away and hides in a garage. The older man finds the parked baby carriage from the lady from before, who seems to be in a store at that time, and like Charlie before he puts the baby into the carriage and walks away. Charlie comes out of his hideout and walks down the street where the lady comes out of the store. She sees the strange baby in her baby carriage and sees Charlie walking by. She gets very upset, runs after him and beats him with an umbrella, dragging him back to the baby carriage. They start discussing once more, the police officer comes by and as the lady starts to explain the situation, Charlie gives in and once againg takes the baby with him. Not knowing what else to do, he sits down on the sidewalk and for a second he considers putting the baby into the sewer.

He loved animals, he loved watching them and playing with them and he loved to keep them all to himself. His oldest companion, a dog named Woof, followed him everywhere he could and helped his master to sniff out new animals. <br/>  One day the boy and his dog found a little frog, took him carelessly with them and forced the poor thing into a glass-jar to be oggled at. In the night, as the boy and his dog were sleeping, the poor frog made a desperate attempt to flee. He used his long legs to move the lid of the glass jar and escaped promptly. <br/>  When the boy woke up the next morning he was astonished to find that his prisoner had escaped. Together with his dog he began to search for desperately, not willing to grant the frog its freedom. He searched far and wide, when he couldn't find him close, he went to the edge of the forest, when he could not find him there, he made his way into the forest. He looked into treetrunks, getting more and more frustrated as he couldn't find the little frog. The dog too looked feverously for it, but couldn't find it either. The boy grew angry and went as far as to climb on a small boulder, hoping to get a better view. He shouted and raged so loud, that even his loyal companion Woof ducked closer to the ground. <br/>  But the boy made a mistake there. A young stag, having heard the raging child and knowing about his callous nature, attacked the boy and tried to attack him to make him leave the forest. The boy and his dog startled and fell into a small pond. As they made their way out of the water and climbed over a fallen treetrunk, they say the frog family desperatly hiding behind it. <br/>  Smiling to himself he reached for the little frog, took him into his hands and waved mockingly at the little frog's upset family, which would never see their son and brother again. <br/>  And so the selfish little boy would continue to steal wild animals from their family and home for his amusement, never truly knowing the pain he caused.

After being hit by rubble twice and lighting a cigarette, he discovers a baby on the ground, wrapped in a blanket. Visibly puzzled, the man gazes around, trying to find out who the baby might belong to. He then picks it up and notices a woman pushing a stroller passing by. He places the baby into the stroller across from another baby, but takes it back after the woman gets mad at him. The man then decides to put the baby back on the ground where he found it, but changes his mind when he encounters a police officer. The man notices an old man with a walking cane and tricks him into holding the baby, whereupon the first man runs off. The old man puts the baby in the same stroller as the previous man and walks away. When the first man walks by the stroller, he gets beaten by the woman and gives in, taking back the baby. Finally, he sits down on the curb, discovers a note hidden in the baby's blanket saying that it is an orphan child. This causes the man to lovingly engage with the child and walk away.

Because he is scared that the baby is going to get hit by rubble that previously fell down on him, too, he picks it up, but does not really seem to know what to do with it. He then sees a woman with a pram and tries to put the child in there. The mother, however, of course notices that this is not her child and makes him take it out again, so Chaplin tries to lay it back down to where he found it, but is caught by a police officer, so he picks it up again. After running around trying to find somewhere to put the baby, he gives it to another man and quickly runs away. That man puts it in the woman's pram again and flees, too. When Chaplin walks past the woman after he was hiding somewhere, she thinks that it was him putting the baby back in there again and hits him with her umbrella until he takes the baby back. After Chaplin even debates leaving it in the drain, he finds a note on the child that states that this child is an orphan, and asks the finder to take care of it and love it. This is where he finally comes to terms with his fate and starts taking care of the baby.

He picks up the crying baby and tries to sneak it into a pram a mother left on the street while running errands. The mother notices and gets angry at Chaplin, who then has to take the baby back. He then tried to lay it back where he found it, but a police man catches him, so Chaplin has to take the baby again. He sees an old man and asks him to hold the baby so Chaplin can tie his shoes. The old man takes the baby and Chaplin runs away. Since the old man is not fast enough to catch him, he lays the baby into the first pram he can find, which is coincidentally the same pram in which Chaplin already has put the baby.  The angry mother thought Chaplin was at fault, found him and handed the baby back. Chaplin sits down on a curb and does not know what he should do with this baby. He even had a quick thought about dumping it in the sewage. Finally Chaplin starts searching in the cloth and blankets the baby is swaddled in and finds a note. The note says „ please love and care for this orphan child“. Now he starts to smile and hold the baby close, accepting his fate.

Timmy also had a frog, that he kept in a jar by his bed. One night as Timmy lay sleeping the frog escaped. When Timmy and Speedo discovered the empty jar in the morning they went on an adventure in the woods to find the frog. They walked over meadows and crawled up each rock searching for the frog. Timmy had crawled up a rock to call for the frog, when suddenly the branches in front of him moved. It was the antlers of a huge stag! The stag picked up Timmy with his antlers and threw him into a pond. Spido fell in along with Timmy trying to catch him. They landed in the pond. Thankfully, it was not al that deep of a pond so they swam to the shore and climbed up an old tree trunk to get out. When they climbed up the tree trunk, Imagine what they saw? It was the frog, surrounded by his little frog family. Timmy realised, that the frog would be much happier living with his family, so he left him by the pond. Timmy and Spido waved the frogs goodbye and went home to think of new animals to rip from their families and take hostage, the little psychopath. And they lived happily ever after... except for the animals, that got abducted that is.

He then realizes a baby is laying on the floor to his left behind a dustbin. He picks it up. It seems like he feels compelled to do so out of empathy. Still, feeling overwelmed he tries to get rid of the baby by placing it in a pram that a mother left unattended.  The mother realizes the attempt to rid himself of the baby and rejects it. After a little back and forth he ends up sitting on the curb with the baby in his arms. He finds a little note that is tucked under the cloth the baby is wrapped in.

He walks past the bricks and is hit by some trash that fell from outside the shot. The line “Awkward ass” appears on a black screen. Chaplin takes out a new cigarette, takes of his gloves, ignites a match with his foot and lights the cigarette. He then throws his gloves in a bin. The next shot shows a crying baby on the floor. He takes a closer look at it and tries to find out where it might have come from by looking up. Chaplin takes up the child. In this moment a woman is walking by in background with a stroller. He walks to her and puts the baby down. The screen says “Pardon me, you dropped something”. The woman starts yelling at the man and he first attempts to take her child away, then his own. The woman furiously walks away. Chaplin then tries to lay the child back on the ground where it came from but a police officer is watching, so he decides to take it with him again. Next Chaplin encounters an old man. He acts like he has to tie his shoelaces and hands the child over to the old man. As soon as he is holding the baby Chaplin runs away. The old man follows him and finds the lady’s stroller. He puts the infant down and walks away. Then the woman returns to her child, only to find the other kid sitting in her stroller again. She sees Chaplin walking by and starts hitting him with her umbrella. She drags him back to the stroller and they argue about the situation. When the police officer returns Chaplin quickly decides to take the child away again. The next scene shows Chaplin and the child alone. They sit down on the street and Chaplin takes a look at the gutter next to him. He decides not to put the child down there and starts playing with it. He suddenly finds a note which he unfolds. It reads: Please love and care for this orphan child. Chaplin smiles at the baby while deciding to keep it. The last shot shows his feet walking away.

After shouting “Awkward ass” he lights up a cigarette. To light the cigarette up he takes off his gloves and throws them in a bin. When he wants to continue his walk he spots a baby which lies, just wrapped up in a blanket, on the pathway. As he thinks that a passing woman with a pram has just dropped the baby he runs to her and puts the baby back in the buggy. The woman becomes furious due to the unfamiliar child in her pram. The protagonist has no other option than taking the child with him again if he doesn’t want to get in a dispute with the woman.  <br/> As he decides to put the baby back to where he had found it a policeman appears behind him. Because he is being watched by the policeman he sees no other option than picking the baby up again and  walks away.  <br/> On his way he sees an old man and gives him the child, runs away and hides. The man, confused because he suddenly has an unfamiliar baby in his arms, seeks for a way to get rid of it as soon as possible.  <br/> When he sees a buggy, he puts the baby in it and goes away.  <br/> Meanwhile, the protagonist leaves the hiding place and runs across the policeman again. Because he doesn’t want to get into trouble with the man he goes away.  <br/> He comes across the woman with the buggy. The woman had already noticed the second baby in her stroller and assumes that the protagonist put the baby in there again. As she sees him passing she gets furious and hits him several times with her umbrella. She wants him to take the child. The policeman appears once again. The protagonist takes the baby and goes away.  <br/> The man, with the baby in his arm, sits down on the pavement and thinks about what he could do next to get rid of the baby. Then he sees a little piece of paper which is attached to the baby’s blanket. It says: “Please love and care for this orphan child.” When he reads that sentence his attitude towards the baby changes immediately and he begins to smile. He gets up and with the baby in his arms he leaves.

He takes a cigarette out of a small tin and lightens it with the help of a match and the sole of his shoe. He then bins his dirty gloves, looks around and finds a crying baby, wrapped in rugs, lying on the ground. He picks the baby up and looks around to see where the baby might have came from. He then sees a woman passing by with a baby carriage with another child in it. As he thinks she has lost the baby he has found he puts the baby into the baby carriage as well. This makes the woman very angry with him, as it is apparently not her child, so the man takes it out again and lies it back to where he has found it. When he turns around, though, a policeman is watching him, so again he picks up the child and walks away. Around the next corner he sees an old man whom he gives the child, deliberately only to do up his laces, but actually he is trying to get rid of the baby and runs away. The old man tries to follow him but cannot find him. Instead he comes by the baby carriage from earlier and, as the mother has left it unattended for a moment, puts the abandoned baby in it and runs away. When the woman comes back to the baby carriage and finds the second baby in it again, she looks around the street and sees the first man (coincidently) walking by. She runs after him, hits on him with her umbrella and drags him back to the baby carriage, where they argue. This is when the policeman comes to see what has happened, so the man takes the baby again and walks away with it. He sits down with the baby on the street, shortly thinking about getting rid of it in the canalisation, but deciding against it. As he looks at the baby alittle closer he finds a note hidden inside the baby's rugs saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child. Having pity with the baby, he smiles at it and takes it home with him."

After brushing it off, he lights a cigar just to find a baby lying next to a trashcan. He sees a woman with a baby carriage walking past, and thinks that it has to be her baby. He puts the baby in the carriage and says to her ""You dropped something"". But she insists that it is not her baby, and demands that he takes it back. After reluctantly taking it back, he decides to put the baby where he found it. After realizing that he is being watched by a policeman, he walks off with the baby and crams it into the arms of an elderly man. This man puts the baby into the woman's baby carriage again. When she realizes the strange baby is back in her carriage, she beats up Charlie Chaplin, who was just walking past her at that moment. The policeman reappears, and the woman demands that Charlie Chaplin takes the baby back. After doing so, he  walks through the alleys and ultimately sits down on the pavement. For a moment, he considers putting the baby into a hole leading to the sewage system, but does not act on it. Then he finds a piece of paper in the baby's cloth, which says the baby is an orphan and needs love and care. He walks off with the baby, and it seems like he has decided to keep it."

As he is looking around himself, he takes a small metal box out of his coat and lights a cigarette. He throws away his gloves and looking down on the ground, he sees a baby that is crying and all wrapped up in a blanket. Chaplin once again looks around as if the child fell from heaven (or even out of the window like the trash earlier) and finally picks it up. He doesn't know what to do with the kid so as he sees a lady with a pram, he thinks it may be her child and puts the baby back in the buggy. The lady seems to be upset and tells him to take the baby back, which he eventually does. Chaplin decides to put the baby back where he found it and an officer appears which leads him to pick the baby up again. As he walks past an old man, he shows him that he has to tie his shoe laces and asks the man to hold his baby and puts it in his arms. Chaplin pretends to tie his laces but runs off and the old man follows him. Chaplin hides and as the man doesn't find him anymore, he puts the baby in the pram of the woman we saw earlier. Chaplin walks past her and she follows him and hits her with an umbrella. She then wants him to take the baby back which he eventually does once the officer is back as well. He leaves and sits down with the baby in his lap. Chaplin seems to think about just putting the child in the sewer but realizes that he can't do it.

Charles Chaplin takes a walk through the dirty back alleys of a city. After lighting a cigarette for himself, he encounters a crying baby hidden behind trash cans. He picks it up and, while looking around for the mother, sees a woman passing by with a stroller. He follows the woman, thinking it might be the baby's mother. But the baby does not appear to belong to the woman, as she starts to complain and argue after Charles put the baby in the stroller, next to another infant. He then proceeds to pick up the baby again, only to be followed by a police officer who observes Charles putting the baby back on the ground by the trash cans where he initially found it. After receiving a stern look from the police officer, Charles picks up the baby again and turns to leave. He next tries to hand the baby over to a random stranger by pretending to tie his shoes while the man holds the baby. But when he runs off, he is followed by the other man. The baby ends up again in the stroller of the same woman as before. Meanwhile, Charles walks into the police officer again who appears to find it suspicious that Charles is no longer carrying a baby. Charles walks away, passes the woman in the street, who by now has found a second infant in her stroller again, and she stops him and beats him with her umbrella, thinking he put the baby there again. A heated discussions ensures, just in time for the police officer to make another appearance. Charles is stuck with the unknown baby again. He briefly considers dropping the baby into a sewer, but decides against it and ends up sitting on the curb with the baby in his lap. Upon closer inspection, he finds a note which implores the finder to please take care of the orphaned baby. The video ends with Charles walking off while cradling the baby in his arms.

Tim realises that he should not have taken the frog away in the first place, since he does not belong in the house of a human being and has his own home.

After narrowly avoiding being covered in garbage thrown out of windows, and after lighting a cigarrette, Chaplin finds an orphaned baby lying next to a garbage can. He picks it up and decides to return it. A mother walks by, pushing her own baby in a baby carriage. Chaplin slips the orphan into the carriage next to the other baby, but the mother notices and protests until Chaplin takes back the orphan. Discouraged, Chaplin plans to place the baby back next to the garbage can where he found it. A stern-looking police officer observes him, which causes Chaplin to change his mind and keep walking with the baby. Around the corner, he sees another passer-by and hands him the orphan. Chaplin runs off and hides, and the confused passer-by, seeking to get rid of the orphan as well, places the baby in the mother's baby carriage. Chaplin, who is now convinced that the matter is resolved, happens to walk by the baby carriage, and the mother suspects him of having slipped the orphan into her carriage a second time. The police officer joins the altercation, and the mother protests to the officer, so that poor Chaplin is forced to take back the orphan yet again. Exhausted, Chaplin sits down on the curb with the orphan in his arm. He finds a note which asks the person who finds the orphan to take loving care of the baby. Chaplin smiles affectionately and appears to accept that responsibility. He stands up, with the baby still in his arms, and walks off scene."

Laying there he finds a baby, wrapped in sheets with a scarf around their head. He picks it up and while looking at the baby a woman with a stroller walks past towards one of the entrances in the back of the alley. When Chaplin sees her, he tries giving back the baby, assuming she dropped it by accident. She demands him to take it out of the stroller, where he previously placed it. Chaplin does so, and brings the baby back to where he found it next to the bins. A police-officer observes the action and when Chaplin notices the officer, he quickly picks the baby off of the ground and into in his arms again and walks back through the alley, where he came from in the beginning. Around the corner a man is walking and Chaplin approaches him, gets him to hold the baby under the pretence of tying his shoelace and while the man is engrossed in looking at the baby, Chaplin flees back around the corner, abandoning child and man. The now confused man brings the baby to what I assume to be a shop, where he sees a child inside a stroller and places the baby inside it as well, before running away as Chaplin did before. A woman exits the doorway and sees the two children in the stroller, one of which is only hers, obviously. Just as she does, Chaplin walks past, she hurries after him, yelling at him while catching up. It is the same woman, that he already tried to give the child to before in the alley. She hits him multiple times with her umbrella and drags him back to the stroller, having him take the baby out again. He refuses, but when the same officer comes back and the woman tries to engage him in the argument, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. He sits down on the curb with the child in his arms and contemplates dropping it in the sewer for a second. But he decides agains it. He takes away the sheets from the child’s neck and notices a piece of paper on which is written a plea to take care of the child, which apparently is orphaned. Taking another look at the child, Chaplin picks up his cane, holding the child and walks with it back through the alley he first came through.

He tries to get rid of the baby by putting it into a baby carriage of a woman passing by. The lady is furious with him and he takes the baby and tries to put it back, where he found it, but a policeman who happened to pass by, watches him and he is obligated to pick the baby back up. Next Chaplin tries to dispose of the child by pretending to have to tie his shoelace, putting the baby into the arms of a passerby, and taking off quickly. The stranger who is now stranded with the baby encounters the same baby carriage, as Chaplin has before and puts the child in there. Meanwhile, Chaplin steps out of a shed he had hid in and almost runs into the same policeman again, so he takes off as fast as he can. Suddenly, the woman, who had parked the baby carriage in front of a store, steps out and sees Chaplin walking by, presuming he tried to get rid of the baby again by putting it into her baby carriage. Furiously, she runs after him, beating him with an umbrella. At the same time, the policeman is coming around the corner and also starts berating Chaplin, who again picks up the child and walks on. Exhausted he sits down on the curb and contemplates sticking the baby into the street drain. But as he looked closer at the baby, he finds a note asking to "" love and care for this orphan child."" In the last scene, he looks lovingly at the child and walks off with it."

Picking the apparently abandoned baby up, Chaplin is trying to figure out what to do when he sees a lady with a stroller passing by. Assuming that she is the mother of the child, he runs after her and, when she turns around, places the baby in the stroller. However, the lady notices and in a displeased manner makes Chaplin understand that the baby is not, in fact, hers, as her own baby is already sitting in the stroller. He is therefore obliged to take the child back. Deciding to bring it back to where he found it, he is caught by a policeman right when he tries to put the baby down next to the trash can. Next, he hands it over to another man while pretending to have to fix his shoe and then runs off. The other man chases after him, yet cannot find him and decides to place the baby in the very same stroller Chaplin had put it in before and which is now standing in front of a shop entrance. The lady, leaving the shop and seeing two babies in her stroller, recognizes Chaplin as he walks by (by accident) and the two enter into a heated discussion. In the middle of their argument, the police officer that Chaplin had encountered before walks by and joins them. Chaplin is, therefore, once again, forced to take the baby with him. He sits down on the boardwalk next to a gully top and takes off the top, obviously contemplating to drop the baby in there. On lifting the child up, he discovers a piece of paper, reading ""please love and care for this orphan child"". He looks at the baby again, his facial expression changing, and apparently has a change of heart: smiling at the child, he lifts it up and walks away holding it in his arms."

Some of the garbage hits his cigar which causes him to light up a new one. As he throws away his worn down gloves, he notices a baby on the floor next to garbage bin and picks it up. While he wonders where it came from, a mother is passing and he puts the child into her pram, thinking that it must be hers. Since he is mistaken she starts protesting and thus Chaplin attempts to return the baby to where he found it. However, he is caught by a police officer and is forced to pick the baby up again. Then he tries to trick a passer-by into holding the baby and runs into hiding. The man follows him but can only find the woman's pram where he leaves the baby. Chaplin comes out of hiding and walks away but the woman, who has already noticed the baby in her pram, sees him and starts beating him with her umbrella. Again, the police officer arrives and Chaplin has to run off with the baby. In another street, he drops his cane and has to sit down to pick it up. For a moment he considers dropping it into the sewers but then takes a closer look at the child. He finds a note that asks the finder to care for the child since it is an orphan. In the end, Chaplin gets up again and decides to take the baby with him.

Where was his froggy? Together with his dog he tried to figure out where he could have gone but all this thinking and not doing anything about it killed the boy. So he set off on the quest to find the little frog with his dog , because two eyes and a dog nose should be able to find the wild frog. They look all over the forest where he found the frog when he first caught it. He climbed trees and stones and yelled for his lost friend at the top of his lungs.While he was standing on a particularly big stone, he leaned over to hold onto what appeared to be branches from a tree but those branch suddenly began to move and picked him up. It was a deer with his giant antlers who carried him to a cliff and threw him off the edge. The poor boy fell into a river where he struggled not to drown. Luckily, he managed to pull him self onto a log that was close. He sat on the log for a while to rest when he spotted a frog family and imagine that -one of the bunch was his little lost froggy friend! The boy,his doggy and the frog are happy to be reunited and lived happily ever after.

He dodges some garbage being thrown out of a window but shortly after entering an alley way he is hit by another load of what looks like food scraps. It looks like in the process he lost his cigarette and so he takes another out of a metal box containing cigarettes and cigars. After taking off his gloves he lights a match by scraping it across the sole of his shoe, lights his cigarette and then throws both the match and his gloves away. Shortly after, the man notices a baby on the ground next to some garbage cans and, after apparently looking around in the air for the origin of the baby picks it up. In the background a woman pushing a pram can be seen walking by. The man turns around and while the woman isn't looking deposits the baby next to the woman's baby that is already inside the pram. The woman returns and the man tells her that she dropped something. She is not impressed by this and demands that he take the baby away again. After first trying to take the wrong baby, the man takes the correct baby to the place where he found it. Turning around, he comes face to face with a police officer and immediately turns around to pick the baby back up again and walks away with it in his arms. Next, he tries to give the baby to an older man walking down a street with a cane by pretending that he has to tie his shoe and after the older man has the baby in his arms he runs away and hides. The older man follows him and comes across the pram of the same women seen earlier. He deposits the baby into the pram and walks away. The man comes out from his hiding place and walks past the woman and her pram again, who has discovered that the same baby has been pushed onto her again. She sees the man walk past and beats him up with her umbrella, dragging him back to the baby by the scruff of his neck and demanding that he take it back. The police officer can be seen approaching and the woman seems to accuse the man, who takes the baby back and sits down on a curb with it. He seems to contemplate putting the baby inside of a street drain, but decides against it. After searching the babies clothes he finds a note saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". The man smiles at the baby and walks away with it in his arms."

As he moves towards the camera, more garbage is dropped from a different window and hits Chaplin on the head. He dusts off his jacket and continues on his way. He stops to retrieve a cigarette butt from a tin in his pocket, takes off his gloves, lights the cigarette, and throws his gloves away. Next to the garbage can, he discovers a baby wrapped in a blanket. He looks up and around, and picks it up. When a woman with a stroller walks by, he quickly follows her to return the lost baby to her. She stops and he places the baby inside her stroller. The baby does not seem to belong to the woman and she gets upset. She sends Chaplin away and he returns to the same spot where the baby was found. When he is about to put it back on the ground, a police officer suddenly appears behind him. Chaplin picks the baby back up and leaves the scene. He stops an old man on the street, asks him to hold the baby, and runs off. The old man tries to follow him but Chaplin is faster and manages to hide. The old man discovers the same stroller from earlier parked outside a shop and places the baby inside it. As the woman comes out of the shop and discovers the strange baby in her stroller, Chaplin walks by and she runs after him. She takes her umbrella, knocks him to the ground, and drags him back to her stroller. The two of them begin to argue and are joined by the police officer. Chaplin takes back the baby and leaves. He sits down on the curb, next to a sewer grate, and opens it, looking at the baby as though he is considering to drop it into the sewer. He quickly changes is mind and closes the grate again. Inside the blanket, in which the baby is wrapped up, Chaplin discovers a handwritten letter. It reads, ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" Realizing that the baby is not lost, he seems to make the decision to keep it. He smiles, gets up, and leaves."

Instead he had grabbed hold of the antlers of a great stag that now impatiently tossed him over a ledge and into a pond. <br/>  The little boy however, did not give up on his search and finally found his frog hidden behind the trunk of a fallen tree. The frog was not on his own though, it was sitting with his entire family of little frogs and Mrs Frog. <br/>  In the end the little boy left the father frog with his family and took one of the little froglets home, waving a happy good-bye to the rest of the frog family.

Well, in fact, I am a big fan of the character that he plays. He is Sheldon Cooper in Big Bang Theory. In my opinion, he is one of the funniest characters ever. I love the way he talks and all his weird thoughts. He does not understand what does sarcasm mean and it causes amusing situations, he takes everything literally. His reactions are amazing. It seems that he does not have feelings and his face does not change at all: it does not matter if he is feeling happy or sad.

The baby was covered inside some cloths and Chaplin didn't know about to do about him. Then, he saw a mother with his child far away, and he wondered that maybe she was also the mother of the child he found, so he gave the child to the woman saying that it was hers. <br/> The woman refused to take care of that baybe since it wasn't hers, so she shouted to Chaplin telling him not to bother her anymore, so Chaplin decided to place the child right where he found him. As he was doing that, a police man who was patrolling around the area stared at Chaplin with a serious look, so Chaplin wasn't able to leave the child where he found him. <br/> Therefore, he started walking around far away from the police man, trying to look for somebody that could take care of that little baby, and then he found another old man around there that could be his perfect target. Chaplin asked the old man If he could take care of the baby for a second, and the right moment he gave him the little boy he started to run away as fast as he could. <br/> However, the old man managed to get rid off the little baby by leaving him in the baby  cart of the mother previously mentioned, and then he also run away. When the mother found that child once again in her baby cart, she thought that it was Chaplin who did that, so as soon as she saw him again she started to beat him with her lady bag with no mercy. Moreover, the police man appeared once again in the scenario while the woman was complaining about Chaplin, so finally Chaplin had to admit his lose and take care of the child. <br/> At the end of the video, we can see how Chaplin thought for a moment to throw the little child into the sewer, but then he regreted it. Then, he took a loot at the baby's cloths and he found a little paper that had the following message written down: ""Take care of this precious child"", and then he decided to take care of him and he suddenly was happy again."

I get a lot of feelings about the video, first because of the action that the main actor takes with the subject, and even more with the circumstances that come before him, but he decides to pick it up and hand it to somebody so that I care because I think that in his mind was that he could not have it for x and circumstance that will happen not knowing that in the end he would touch staying with him because they watched him not letting go of what he found; Nevertheless this makes much presence in our lives in occasions that finds people without waiting them that in the end one wants to remove them completely of our lives but that with actions that are incorporated within the moment does not let us let go until accepting the reality that is Is living.

Chaplin in his films denounced several injustices that existed at that time. His movies aside from spending a good time laughing, they have several subliminal messages about what society is like. <br/> In my opinion Chaplin is the best  comedic actor in the silenc film.

People are throwing rubbish out of their windows, and Mr. Chaplin gets hit twice by the falling rubbish. All of a sudden, he realises that there is something more than rubbish laying on the floor; there is an abandoned child. Confused, Mr. Chaplin, looks around to see if he can find the child's parents. When a lady who is carrying a pushchair  passes by, he assumes that the lady had lost or abandoned the child. When he hands the baby over to the lady, the lady reacts furiously, as the baby is not hers.  <br/>  <br/> Disappointed, Mr. Chaplin decices to leave the baby back where it was, when he walks into a police officer, who stares at him when he sees Mr. Chaplin leaving a baby on the streets. Having changed his mind due to the presence of the angry-looking officer, he hands the baby to an anonymous man who he sees in a nearby street.

These girls have a lot of problems in the high school because they do what they want in every moment.Their parents are always angry with them because they dont follow any ruler. On the one hand the problems belong to fights between popular and marginalized student's. On the other hand we usually see the discussions among the parent's.

While an English man is walking around the town, there were people working in the buildings, throwing from the window some bullshit that drops into this English man. He continued walking, but when he was going to smoke a cigarrette, he found a litlle boy crying in the street.  <br/> He decided to take him and tried to look for the baby's family. Sudently he saw a woman carrying on a baby, he asked her if the baby is hers, but it wasn't. <br/> He kept on trying to find his family but it had no result. So he thought to give the baby to a stranger was the best option. Ironically this stranger found the same woman that the English man met before and he put the baby in her trolley with her daughter. When the woman found the baby again in her trolley, the English man was walking around the same street, so she thought he was doing again the same thing than before. She lashed him and also told the police what happened. Now the baby is again with the English man and, after trying everything to find the family of the baby,  he finally decided to take care of him.

This one finds the baby cart's woman on his way and leaves the baby on it. The lady finds the baby in her cart again.

As a result of that meeting, he tries to leave the baby to anyone who is on the streets because he doesn't want to be responsible for him. For example, he tries to give him to a woman that has a cart in which there's already a baby or to a vagabond who is having a walk quietly. It is also interesting the fact that he meets a policeman everytime he gives the child to someone and the policeman thinks the baby is from Chaplin and that he wants to leave him. Despite all the attempts, the baby in one way or another returns to Chaplin's arms and he finds a note that was in the baby's clothes. The note explains that the people that has left the child wants him to be treated with love. This note convinces Chaplin and he decides to take care of him.

However, the owner of the trolley appears, who is the woman appearing before, and by coincidence, Chaplin is wandering around. Thus, the woman thinks that the same man has tried to cheat her twice.

What's more, when he throwing away his gloves, he finds a little baby. The baby is crying and Charles is searching for someone but there's nobody there. Charles holds the child and, from somewhere, appears a woman with a baby carriage with another boy in it. He starts to follow her, he catches her and puts the baby into the baby carriage. Instantly, the woman sees him and starts yelling at him. In the screen appears what Charles says to her: ‘Pardon me, you dropped something.’ However, the woman shouts at him to take away the baby and he runs away holding him. <br/> In the next scenes he decides to let the baby in the floor again, nevertheless an officer appears, so he has to runs again with the baby in his arms. Then he finds an old man and he leave the kid with him. When the man holds the baby, Charles starts to run again and he hides so the old man cannot return him the kid. The old man tries to find him, but instead, he finds the baby carriage, which appeared in the other scene, and puts the baby into it. Finally, Charles get out of his hiding place but the officer appears again, and runs. We see how other people across the same street as the baby carriage is, but when is Charles’s turn, the woman see him again, catch him and starts to hit him. They discuss about the baby and when the officer appears, again, he has to hold the baby. <br/> Without knowing what to do, he sit on the floor and for an instant he thinks about letting the baby in sewers, but immediately refuses it.

He does things that ordinary people wouldn't do. For instance, to a light a cigarette with a shoe. While he's smoking this cigarette, he finds a kid abandoned. He doesn't know what to do and he starts looking everywhere to guess who is the mother but he doesn't find an answer. The only thing he knows is that he doesn't want to take care of him; so he tries to find a person to do it but he doesn't have success. He even tries to leave him where he found him, but a policeman sees him doing it, so he doesn't have any other option and keeps on looking for a person to take care of him. At the end of the scene, he realizes that he wouldn't find a person and he decides to take care of him. What made him make a decision is a letter that he finds with a child. After reading it, he realizes that he was the perfect person he was looking for."

Guddu did not want him to come because they had to work the whole night, but Saroo was so stubborn and finally, he could go with his older brother.  <br/>  <br/> While they were working, Saroo was so sleepy and he could not help sleeping on a bench. Guddu had to go somewhere so he told his brother not to move from that bench. But, when Saroo woke up, he started looking for Guddu in one of the trains at the train station he had slept for a while. Suddenly, the train started moving and he travelled to the other part of India. <br/>  <br/>  When he arrived, he could not tell anyone where he was from or even the name of her mother. So he survived living on the street with other kids like him. After a few months living in that conditions, he could live in a orphanage where he was not treated so good. Staying there he could be adopted by a family in Australia with a beautiful house in a nice neighbourhood. There, he lived so happy, and his parents adopted another boy who was a little bit trouble maker. He could study for being a recepcionist at a hotel. <br/>  <br/> When he was 26 years old, he realized he wanted to meet her family so he started searching for places he could remember using Google Maps, after being months and months searching, he recognized the street where his house was.  <br/>  <br/> He told his parents in Australia that he wanted to go there to see his biological family and they completely understood, so when he arrived there his mother and his sister recognized him, and they all were so happy.

Firstly he passed through a drop of work material as it could be cement. Secondly he founded a baby that at first he thought someone must have lost him so he keep on trying to give it to someone else in order to feel free again with any responsability or blame but then he realised that the baby was and an orphan and something on his inside changed. Finally he decided to keep it. To conclude we can highlight the fact that how quick can change our lifes without even noticing about it.

The man takes the baby and he tries to give it to a woman when she is not aware of it. He lets the baby inside the woman's baby carriage, but the woman notices it so she gives the baby back to the man because she doesn't want it. He sees a policeman that is taking a walk so he conceals. Then, he sees a man and he asks for him to hold the baby while he ties up his shoes and suddenly he (Chaplin) runs out so the man stays with the baby. The man makes the same tactic about the woman's baby carriage that Chaplin did before and he gets to scape from keeping the baby. Chaplin passes next to that woman who has seen already the baby and she starts to follow him to give him back the baby, and finally she reaches him. Chaplin doesn't know what to do anymore so he sits down on the ground with the baby on his arms and suddenly he sees a note that the baby has inside his clothes and it says that the person who found that orphan baby took care of him and loved him, so Chaplin heeds it and stays with the baby at the end.

He goes under a window where a man is throwing something that provoques some dust, this is ignored by the protagonist. He keeps on walking and while he grabs his flexible walking stick, a lot of rubbish coming from above him, falls over Charlie making him dirty and also scaring him. Then he decides to take his gloves off and throwing them to the rubbish and to smoke a cigarette he took from a metallic box that he had in his pocket. It is then when he finds out there is a baby left on the street's floor crying, so he decides to get the baby and see if he can solve this problem. Chaplin starts looking around and then suddenly sees a woman with a baby car who seems to be looking for something, this makes him thiink it is the baby's mother. When he gets close and gives the baby to the woman, he finds out that he is confused and that the baby does not belong to that woman. After trying to leave the baby back to where he found it, a police walks in the place and make him get the child again. This leeds our protagonist to do what he does next, to fool a man he sees in the street and to give him the baby. This new man does not know what to do and as he sees a baby car with an empty place, he decides to leave the baby there. Yes, it was the first woman's baby car and unfortunately, she comes of the establishment she is in, coinciding with Charlie again, so she thinks this time it was him too who is trying to deceive her. Finally, Chaplin finds himself one more time with the child and after considering the option of leaving him, he observes a paper into the baby's clothes that says to love and to take care of that orphan boy.

The same directors that the famous American Horror Story. His genre is drama with comedy and action. Perfect balanced. I really really recommend it.

He kept on walking smoking a cigarrette by the way he found a 2-month baby lying on the floor. He took the baby and looked for someone to take care of, so he saw a woman with another baby and tried to deliver him to her, although that woman wasn't his mom so she didn't accept the kid. <br/> In fact, the woman hit him on the back because she thought he was kidnapping her baby. <br/> He took off the baby and went to the corner where he found the baby and came to left him there, but a policeman watched him and he had to runaway with the baby. Some meters after that, another man walking on the street and Chaplin didn't lose the chance, he tried to give this man the problem..and the real problem came now, whe this new man tried to deliver the baby to the same woman as Chaplin tried before. Then, Chaplin kept on his walk and he watched that woman again..she run to him from his back and hit him again on the head, she left him with the baby and leave the scene.

Walking through a place where there is garbage, he picks up another cigarette and while smoking it, he finds a baby on the ground abandoned. He decides to pick it up and at that moment he finds a woman with a stroller for two babies. Seeing that this woman only had one baby in the cart, he places it in the other part of it, thinking that it would belong to the woman. The woman returns the baby to him because it was not hers. Not finding his parents, he places him where he was but at that moment, a policeman appears so he must pick up the baby again so as not to be scolded by the agent. Walking down the street, he gives the baby to a man who passes by. The man, not wanting the baby, casually places the baby in the stroller of the woman who appeared earlier. When the woman realized that the baby was back in the stroller, she blames Chaplin. In addition, the policeman appears, so Chaplin keeps the baby. At the end we see how the baby carried a note that said take care of him. Chaplin decides to stay with him permanently.

Then, he was going to place the baby in the same spot he was found but a policy agent was watching him, so he could not. After that, he came up with the idea of giving it to a strange with the following excuse ""can you hold my baby for a second please?"". Surprisingly, he could get rid of the baby, but it was just for a minute, since the strange placed the baby in the same baby buggy that Chaplin did, so the woman hit Chaplin several times as soon as she saw him again. Finally, Chaplin had to get the baby out of there and when he was far enough he planned to throw it to the sewage. However, he founded a letter between the cloths of the baby, in which was written the following sentence: ""Please take care of the child"" and after reading that, Chaplin couldn't do anything else than taking care of the baby by his own."

It is about a guy called Miguel who dreams of being a famous singer like his role model, Ernesto. However, music is not allowed at home because his great-great-grandfather abandoned his great-great-grandmother and their daughter who is still alive and her name is Coco. Day of the Dead arrives and the family decorate their home with ancestors’ photos and offerings. Miguel realises that a photo in which Coco, her mother and her father appear, the figure that corresponds to the father lacks the head. He also sees that the man has the same guitar as his idol Ernesto. In spite of the forbidding of his family about music, Miguel decides to go to a musical competition, but his grandmother breaks his guitar. Miguel steals the Ernesto’s guitar for participating in the competition, however, playing the guitar, Miguel is transferring to the dead world with his friend Dante, a dog. For leaving this word, he has to have the blessing of one of his ancestors and he decides that his idol Ernesto would do this for him. He lives many adventures in the dead world with his dog and in the road, Dante guides him to Héctor, a man who has never been remembered and who will disappear if nobody in the alive world gives offering to him. Héctor knows Ernesto and helps Miguel to meet with him and in that way, to leave this world. As a change, Miguel has to put a photo at home and he won’t disappear. When Ernesto is going to bless Miguel, Héctor reclaims him the promise. In that situation, Ernesto recognises that Héctor was the writer of his songs and he also assumes that he killed Héctor for stealing the songs that he had written. Ernesto takes away the photo of Héctor and in that way, Miguel cannot put it at home and he won’t be remembered. Miguel and Héctor are in a deep water well and Héctor starts to sing a famous song called “Remember me”. Miguel realises that his great-great-grandfather is Héctor. Thanks Imelda, the wife of Héctor, Miguel returns to the world and tries that Héctor’s daughter, Coco, remembering him and he would not disappear. The problem is that Coco is losing her memory, and as a final attempt, he sings the song “Remember me” and Coco starts to remember her father. So Héctor won’t disappear and also Coco recovers the awareness of her familiar surroundings.

He is cunningly treating a really serious and tragic topic through a humoristic sketch. At Chaplin's time, many orphans were abandoned on the streets or in front of orphanage because their, normally, single mothers were unable to give them the life they deserve. In other cases, they abandoned them because they were not supposed to have children or those children were the result of a rape and that fact had to be hidden no matter what it cost. Some of the kids died and many others stayed their whole life in a place where they were not happy nor well-treated. Fortunately, several children had the chance of a brand new life when people like our protagonist decided to take care of those little and vulnerable souls.

There is plenty of rubbish in the street and he seems to be a bit exhasperated. Then, he finds a baby in a corner and he takes him and looks around in order to find his parents, but no one is there. Afterwards there appears a woman carrying another baby and Chaplin tries to leave his with them, but the lady rejects him rudely. When Chaplin realises the issue he has, he tries to leave the child where he has found him a moment before, but, as soon as he does it, a policeman comes into the scene and he has to take the baby back. Then, he gaves him to a homeless and that man manages to leave the baby with the woman, as Chaplin has tried. Unfortunately, Chaplin is found by the lady, who gives the baby to him. Chaplin sits down in the border of the sidewalk and there he finds a note written by the parents of the baby among his clothes. They ask for taking care of the baby and so Chaplin does.

The first one seems to be well dressed, although it is contradictory at the moment in which a cigarette case appears and he appropriates it. He is in an alley where he is struck by debris. After this, a baby is found lying on the street with no one around. At this point, the protagonist does not know very well what to do and desperately he tries to get rid of him but he can’t achieve it. Suddenly he stumbles over the police and picks up the baby again. However, he continues in the attempt to get rid of the baby by leaving him to another man who appears in the street. The man returns the baby to a baby car and the owner of it returns him to Charles Chaplin again. It seems as if it was fate, trying to give the protagonist somebody to stay with, to stop that feeling of loneliness that he may have. He is still thinking of somewhere to leave the baby but he seems to be worried in turn and he seems to be accepting the reality. Then, he finds a note inside the baby's clothes in which someone asks the one who finds the baby to love and care for him, because he is orphaned. Suddenly, the man seems to feel sorry and at the same time content. Finally, he begins to make the baby smile and leaves with him. The video presents a tone of tragedy where there is fear and pity but at the end there is a sense of happiness and hope for that baby.

So far in the family, the person who was always in charge of taking care of the children and their affaires was the mother, whereas the family father was an informatic who was the one that brought home the bacon. <br/>  Later in the film, the woman told her husband to travel abroad together in lrder to celebrate their aniversary, but in the last moment her husband told her that he could not afford going with her because of his work. This really made her upset and she went on travel with her friend, telling her husband that he should be now in charge of the children (he did not complain about that). <br/>  The thing is that once she was already abroad and the family father was in charge of the family alone, he realised that it wasn't as easy as he imagined. He had quite a lot of problems trying to compaginate his work with his children affaires, and although he tried his best to do it, he finally had to quit from his work to take care of them in the right way. <br/>  When his wife came back from the trip they had changed their roles inside the family, since from that moment the father was ghe one in charge of the children and the mother was focused on her new work and bringing money to home.

Chaplin decides that he has to find a place for the baby and therefore, he starts thinking what to do. Suddenly, he sees a woman that is carrying her own baby on a trolley. Chaplin thinks that the baby is hers or that maybe she could take care of him. However, when Chaplin puts the baby in the trolley, the woman shouts at him as the baby is not hers. Because of that, Chaplin decides to put the baby again on the place where he found him but, a police officer warns Chaplin that he cannot abandone a baby, as if he or she was his own child. Chaplin takes the baby again on his arms and starts walking on the street. He sees another man and Chaplin gives the baby to him. This aforementioned man sees the trolley of the prior woman again.

During the movie, this clown kept scaring people that came on his way. Most of the time, the scene takes place in a house, where the clown looks for his victims in order to kill them. It is very convenient since it is based on a halloween night, so some characters are already wearing some costumes and the clown is not perceived as a maniacal in the beginning.

Besides, he talks to a woman with another baby and asks to her if it is her baby too. She denies it so he brings the baby back to the bin but a police man sees him. Afterwards he sees an old man in the street, gives the baby to him and runs away. Apart from that, the old man leaves the baby in the women's baby stroller. Moreover, when she finds the baby there she suspects of Chaplin and starts sticking him with an umbrella. On the other hand, she tells everything to the policeman so Chaplin takes the baby with him and goes away.

I've always been a great fan of Jason Stathan, so I decided to watch it. The film is the second part of an ancient one with the same title: Mechanic. At the end of that one, Bishop (the main character) pretends his own death because he wanted to leave his world full of risk, guns, and destruccion. But in the new film, his girlfriend has been hijacked and he has to kill some powerful people in the name of those hijacker, because they have told him that if he doesn't kill them, they would kill his girlfriend. However, instead of killing the last objective, he tries to set a trap to the hijackers with the help of the last man. After a hard fight in a ship (that exploted at the end) the girl was rescued but Bishop died with the explosion. Or we though that he did, because at the end, they show us a little space from where he appears. After that, he meets again his girlfriend.

Suddenly, a woman appeared running with a baby trolley and Chaplin thought it was the baby's mum. He talked with her about the baby, but the mum replied that he was not her baby. After that, Chaplin tried to leave the baby in the first place he found it, but the police arrived and, afraid about that wrong action, Chaplin decided to take the baby away with him.

It begins with him walking down the street and getting hit by a trash bin, afterwards he complains about it to the person who has thrown him the bin and when he looks down to the flooor to point the rubbish he notices thaat there is a baby covered in matresses who has been abanoned. Then he decides that he has to pick it up to find out a solution. After this he sees a woman that is in the same street with her baby so he supposses that the baby he has just found on the floor must be hers and he gives it to her and leaves; as soon as he is leaving the woman starts screaming at him because that is not her baby so he has to take it again and find out another solution. <br/> Afterwards he sees what it looks like a homeless person that according to Charles is the perfect person to take care of the baby and he jokes him by asking to carry the baby for a second while he ties his shoes, but instead he starts running away and leaves the baby with this randome person. <br/> Later on there is a scene in which this person sees the previous woman that was with her baby again and he has the exact same idea of giving it to her assuing its hers, but in this case the woman does not notice and when she finds out the baby is again with her  she sees Charles passing by again and starts screaming at him. Thus Charles has to carry again with the abandoned baby. And in the last seconds of the movie we can see how Charles takes a note out of the matresses's baby which says to take care of the baby

Unfortunately, a police officer sees what he was doing, so Chaplin picks up the baby from the floor. Chaplin finds an old man on a walk and gives the baby to him. The old man finds the woman with the trolley and gives the baby to her, but he drops the scarf.

He is not that lucky with the second person who's doing the same, and all the garbage falls on him. He seems a little bit upset and shakes off his suit; then, he picks one of the many unfinished cigars he has in his tobacco pouch, takes off his gloves, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking, finally throwing his gloves to the bin next to him. All of a sudden, a baby starts crying, the poor thing is wrapped with sheets next to somebody's trash. Chaplin looks up, left and right, confused. He decides to take the baby when a woman, pushing a pram, is crossing the street behind; he thinks the baby might be hers and leaves him or her inside with the other baby. The woman starts yelling at him/her so, he takes him/her back to where he found him/her. But, a police officer, who's watching, thinks he is abandoning the baby; therefore, Chaplin has to take the kid again in his arms and leaves. He finds an old man, and asks him to take the baby while he fixes his shoe, but he runs away. The old man goes after him but he is hidden. <br/> The old man sees the pram half empty and lies the baby there. Chaplin comes out of his secret place and walks the officer again as if nothing would have happened. When he thinks it all has ended, he runs into the woman with the pram and she hits him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby; the presence of the officer in the scene again makes him leave quickly with the kid in his arms, not so sure of what to do. He seats on the sidewalk,  looking at the baby and he finds a note in the sheets the kid's covered with which says 'please, love and care for this orphan child', and he finally keeps him/her.

In this scene, Charles Chaplin finds an abandoned child in the middle of the street. Initially, he tries to get rid of him by putting him in the baby carriage of a lady who was walking down the street with her son. However, this lady rejects him with great anger. Next, Chaplin tries to return the boy to where he found him, but a policeman who was passing by there stares at him and he ends up picking up the baby again. Finally, he manages to leave it to a lame man, apparently a homeless man, who decides to leave it again in the lady's baby carriage.

It was recorded and filmed in Germany and it belongs to the expresionist cinema period. The decorations are very interesting because they reflex perfectly this movement (the expresionist one) with the rare representation of the streets and the proyection of the light. The film is about a writter who visits with his friend a fair and ends up entering in an attraction exposed as ""el gabinete del doctor caligari"". Inside the tend there's a weird doctor who's giving a show to all the spectators. The show consists in his attempt and achievement of waking up a guy who has a dreaming transtorn. The doctor claims that the guy with the trastorn knows everything so anybody could ask anything to be answered. The writter's friend asks him when he would  die and he answered ""that night"". Next morning the writter's friend was found dead. The day before another murder was committed. The writter decides to investigate that case because he thought that the murderer was the doctor. He spent all night watching out doctor's loan but he found no evidences to accuse him. Finally it is discovered that the dreaming transtorn's guy was the murderer because the doctor had been hypnotising him while taking advantage of his illness. The end is really surprising because we actually found out that the writter, has gone mad and everything was made up with by his own mind. The plot reminds us on ""Shutter island"",a posterior film that ends in the same way."

After that, he lights a cigarette and realises that there is a baby on the floor of the street. He picks him up and puts him into a baby buggy that a lady is pushing, but that she gives back to Chaplin with anger. He returns the baby back to the place where he found him at the beggining, when a police officer appears forcing Chaplin not to leave the baby there. He finds another man on the street and puts the baby in his arms as he pretends to tie his shoes and then he runs aways.

However, he cannot fulfill his dream because he has not got the means to achieve it. He has a poor job as a clown and he lives with his old sick mother. In addition, he has a mental illness and he laughs for long periods with a strange and nasty laughter. <br/> In the end, he becomes even more mad and violent. He appears in a comedy program and kills whoever he fancies, his idol and people from the audience. A series of events happen in between and he results in a social figure admired by a mass of individuals. The reason to do this, is protesting against the current system. Political and social instituitions do not carry a substantial job. The moral of the film is that past traumas can have a big infuence on people. Does society realise the limits between goodness and evilness?"

But the woman gets mad about it and Chaplin has to take the baby back and leave him or her back in the street. Then, another man shows up and grabs the baby as well but he doesn't know what to do with him or her, so, again, he leaves the baby in the same baby carriage that he finds while the owner is not looking. As the police is waching around, these characters are trying to scape from him. Finally, Chaplin has to grab the baby again, but he discovers a note that the baby has hidden between the blankets.

This movie tells us about the origins of the mighty villain of the ""Batman"" series in a new and more realistic way, critizising our individualistic and capitalist society. It has been massively acclaimed by the audience and the critics. In my view it has been enormously overrated, though. I am not meaning it is a 'bad' story at all, but the rates this film is reaching in portals such as FilmAffinity are incomprenhensible.

He is not having a good day: things fall from above him, and when he tries to smoke he realises he doesn't have that much cigarrettes. He suddenly founds a little baby in the middle of the street. Who could he belong to? He picks it up and decides that a lady who is walking in the street close to him must be her mother o a good stepmother, since she already has one in his baby car. The lady doesn't want the baby, hence he decides to leave it in the same place he found him. In the right moment he's leaving him, a policeman arrives, looks to him, and Charlie has no other option than pick up the abandoned kid... again. Later on, the tried to give the baby to a beggar in the street, but failed, so he tried again with the lady he met in the first place, but the lady still doesn't want a kid that is not hers and gets really angry at him, she even beats him with her handbad.

It is a bizarre film, where a doctor has kidnapped a person to test on her a new kind of skin which he has invented. After the presentation we know the story of the girl kidnapped and the one of the doctor, and it is then when the story begins to turn a bite wear because the girl wasn't a girl before. She was a teenager boy who allegedly tried to rape the doctor's daughter. She was really affected by  what hapened and committed suicide. The doctor, as a revenge, changed the boys gender and after, began to test his skin and created a new face for the former boy. This new face was like the doctor's wife. So, at the end the doctor falls in love with the kidnapped boy/girl, but she/he is thinking about to leave and kills the doctor.

As a woman comes by with a baby buggy, Charles Chaplin thinks that the baby might have fallen out of it, so he puts him on it with the other child, but the woman gets angry with him and tells him to take his kid and stay away from them. Later, Chaplin tries to return the baby to where he found him, however, as a policeman is watching him, he has to take the kid again with him. Then, Chaplin attempts to leave the child with an old man by faking that he has to tie his shoes and running afterwards. Nevertheless, the old man leaves the child on a baby buggy he founds, which is that from the woman that appeared on the previous scene. When she notices the new baby and identifies Chaplin on the street, she attacks him with her umbrella and makes him take the unknown child with him again. Meanwhile, the policeman observes them. Later, he thinks about leaving the child in a sewer, but refuses the idea and, when he does, he finds a letter inside the baby clothes and discovers that it is an orphan kid.

Then, he sees an abandoned child and tries to return him to whom he thought was the mother. Nevertheless, it is not her baby and the protagonist decides to leave the kid where he found him, but a policeman sees him and prevents him from doing it. Then, Chaplin intends to give the child to a random pedestrian, who will try to return him to the same mother that the main character saw earlier. However, when Chaplin passes by, the woman gives to him the creature. Finally, the protagonist adopts the child when he discovers, thanks to a note that the child was carrying, that he was an orphan boy.

Chaplin	written_online	70	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	This video starts with some bricks falling from what seems to be a cantiere. Chaplin, who is under it, goes away from. With his typical way of walking, he starts to smoke. As he goes into the nearest part of the scene to us: he makes sure that his walking stick is flexible enough, he recolocates his hat when suddenly some rubbish falls from the sky so he gets dirty. He swears. <br/>  <br/>  When he arrives to that part of the scene, he looks at the rubbish bin and also finds out that he only has one cigarette left, which he puts in his mouth. He puts off his gloves and starts a fire with the sole and the match in order to turn on the cigarette. He throws away the match and, as he doesn’t know where he can put his gloves, he throws them to the bin. He shakes his hands and as his is smoking he discovers a baby wrapped in a blanket. He cannot really believe it. He looks up several as he was trying to find out how did the baby had got in there. He looks again to the baby and he takes it as a woman with a stroller is passing by just right behind him. <br/>  <br/>  He looks up again and is when he looks down again when he realises that there is a  woman that has just left the stroller in the street while she has got into a shop. The baby might be hers. He tries to call her attention but as it wasn’t successful he goes to the stroller (where there is another baby) and puts the unknown baby inside. <br/> When the woman comes out she finds out that a stranger (Chaplin) is putting a baby into her stroller. He tells the woman that she has dropped something (something-> the baby) but the woman does not seem to share his opinion. She starts shouting at Chaplin so he has to take the baby again as the woman leaves with the stroller (in the scene of taking again the baby he nearly took the baby that is not the unknown one).  <br/>  <br/> As he cannot take care of him he decides to put the baby again where he found it. He puts it in the floor again but he realised that a police officer was just behind him so takes again the baby and goes away while looking at the police officer. He gets into a different street and he finds an old man walking with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the old man to hold for a minute the baby because he has to tie up his shoelaces. He fakes the action of tiying and when the old man is not looking he runs away. When the old man realises, he also starts to walk quickly after him. <br/>  <br/> Now we are again in the first scenario where we can see Chaplin hiding in a kind of streetwardrove. We see again the old man running with the baby and trying to find Chaplin satisfactorily. However, the old man finds the previous stroller without (the woman is not there) so he decides to put the baby in there and run away.  <br/>  <br/> As Chaplin gets out of his hiding place, the police officer is having a walk over there and finds out that Chaplin is there. When Chaplin sees him he goes just the other way round.  <br/>  <br/> We can see again the stroller with the two babies while some men are passing by. But, is Chaplin the one who is passing by when the woman gets out of the shop and realises that there are, again, two babies. She sees Chaplin so she takes her umbrella and starts running after Chaplin. When she is near enough she kicks him with the umbrella. She also throws him to the floor and kicks him several times when he gets up. She takes him to the stroller in order to him to take away the baby. The police officer, who his walking around hears the noise so he goes to where they are arguing. The woman seems to be very upset and explains to the police officer in a really effusive way what happened. Chaplin tries also to convince the police officer but he realises there is nothing to do with it so he takes again the baby. He goes away, also the woman does and the only one who stays in the place is the police officer who waits several seconds before leaving the scene.  <br/>  <br/> Now, we can see Chaplin again. He is standing up looking around, like he was wondering what to do. He sighs, he changes the baby’s position and he sits in the sidewalk. When he is sat down he puts away his walking stick. Just right him there is sewer which he opens, looks at the baby and he seems to be about putting the baby overthere but he changes opinion and closes the sewer. He looks several times at the baby, he changes again the position of the baby and he licks his fingers because it looks like the baby has bitten him.  <br/> He looks inside the baby’s blanket and finds out that there is a paper. He recolocates the lapel of his jacket and he starts reading it. It is a white note where it is written “Please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin looks again at the baby, with love, and puts the note inside his jacket while he keeps looking at the baby.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin smiles, holds harder to the child, takes his walking stick and stands up. He changes direction and starts walking away.

We as audience know about the plot from an old woman's perspective, that is, from the reconstruction of her memories about a recent past. In the story,  Rose and Jack are the main characters, two passengers who would take part in the Titanic experience, a  technological British enterprise of greatness and luxury.  <br/> However, they belong to completely opposite social classes. Whereas Rose is from upper class level, Jack is a poor man who won a third-class ticket to sail the ship by playing poker. But, in spite of their apparently enormous differences, they madly fall in love to each other. The strong emotional bond they establish will also be their worst medicine. When the Titanic  hits the big ice iceberg and begins to sink, everyone is desperately trying to save his/her life. Rose and Jack eventually found each other and manage to get out of the ship. Nevertheless,  Jack finally dies, getting frozen in the icy waters, while Rose stays on a boat staring at him and crying over his corpse.

Everything was torn apart because of the natural disaster which had just taken place. They split up due to the massive water waves which had just hit the country. The mother of the family was badly injured and she was about to lose one of her legs. Fortunately, she was not alone as his eldest kid found her hanging from a palm tree. Later in the film, we can see how the whole family gets back together and flies to Singapore in order for the mother to have surgery on her leg. At the end of the film, they are all safe and sound.

Next, he finds a woman with her baby, so he may think that she is the mother of the baby he has already found. However, she is not the person he is looking for. After that, he returns to the place where he has found the baby previously to leave him/her there. Unfortunately, I can see a policeman near the place where Chaplin is and I guess that this policeman thinks that Chaplin is trying to abandon the baby right there. For this reason, Chaplin does not leave the bay there and continues walking. Next, he encounters a man and Chaplin asks him to take care of the baby while he is doing something with his shoes. In this moment, Chaplin starts running because he does not know what he could do with the orphan baby. Based on this, I believe that Chaplin tries to leave the man he finds on the street with the baby to avoid himself some problems. Nevertheless, he has to take care of the baby again. <br/> Chaplin sees again the baby that the mother was carrying with herself previously, so that he tries again to leave the baby with this woman again, but he fails. <br/> Finally, he sits down and reads a paper that he finds inside the clothes of the baby.

Then, he grabs the baby and runs into a woman pushing a baby carriage who seems to have lost something. Chaplin approaches the woman and leaves the baby inside the carriage but she refuses immediately since that baby is not hers. Chaplin, confused, grabs the baby again and leaves the woman behind. He thinks that leaving the baby in the same place he found him/her would be the solution, but a policeman appears making Chaplin to stop his attempt to abandon the baby and leaves. On his way, he encounters a man asking him to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes and starts running. Everything was just fine for Chaplin, but little did he spect that the man would place the baby on the same baby carriage he tried before. Unfortunately, Chaplin walks through the same street where the woman mentioned before was and when she sees him she starts hitting Caplin with an umbrella claiming that he was the one who place the baby inside again. The policeman shows during the argument and Chaplin has to take the baby with him again. Chaplin is really frustrated and upset about the situation, he has to take care of a baby that is not his own, but suddenly he grabs a hand-written note asking to love and care the orphan baby. Hence, Chaplin, due to the moving note, decides to keep the baby with him.

He does not seem much bothered and takes off his gloves and ligths up a cigar. He later throw his gloves to the rubbish bin.  <br/> At some point, he saw a baby in a corner of the street, right behind another bin, and hold him up to see him more clearly. Then, he sees a woman with another child and thinks that she might have lost that baby so he places him on the baby carriage. The woman seems upset by this reaction because it is not her baby and hits Chaplin to show her anger and make him go away. As a result, Chaplin goes again to the corner where he found the baby, in order to put him where he was found. However, a policeman saw him and angrily told him not to do so, which makes Chaplin move to another street, where he finds a man and, pretending that he has to tie her shoelaces, he tricks the man to get rid of the baby and leaving him in the arms of this man. This person, in another street, sees a baby carriage and decides to place the baby there in order to get rid of him. However, the woman, when she comes out of the grocery shop, sees Chaplin walking down the street and, again, hits him to show her annoance and make him go back to the carriage and take the baby again.  <br/> With the baby in his arms, Chaplin is confused and tired.

Suddenly, a pile of leaves falls on him, extinguishing his cigarette. Once he lights it again, he discovers a baby behind a barrel. Charles starts looking around for his parents, when suddenly a lady with a stroller passes by and he deduces that the baby is hers. Once he puts the baby in it, the woman notices and gets very angry with him. Charles then decides to leave the baby in the same place where he found him. However, a policeman appears and he prefers to take the baby back to avoid any trouble. Later, he meets an older man and asks him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes. Once he agrees, Charles runs away and hides, willing to get rid of the baby. The older man, without knowing what to do, leaves the baby in the same stroller as before. The woman with the stroller, on leaving the shop, discovers that the baby has been put back there. Just then, Charles crosses her path and the woman, again very upset, hits him with her umbrella. After that, he sits down on the pavement with the baby, and thinks for a moment about putting the baby down a sewer. At that moment, however, he discovers a note among the baby's blankets, asking for the orphaned baby to be taken care of. Finally, moved by the story, it seems that Charles is going to keep the baby.

I had so much expectations on it so I went to the cinema with my friends. In my opinion, the film was a perfect ending of the first one. It had everything on it: action, romance, fantasy... <br/> At the beggining, Maleficient's daughter (who had become the swamp's queen) tell her that she is going to get married but her mother refuse to that. After a long thinking she gets convinced by her daughter to go to a dinner with the groom's parents. They are kings.  <br/> The groom's mother, who is the evil character of this film, makes Maleficient angry in order to ambush her and let the rest think that she has cursed the king.  <br/> Her daughter gets angry with her and refuse to go home, so Maleficient goes away. In her path, she gets shooted by the queen's assistant. Suddenly, a creature that looks like Maleficient save her and take her to a land where live lots like her. She didn't know about the existence of that place. There, she gets told that she is the Queen of that place and that she is the Fenix.  <br/> Meanwhile in the groom's kingdom, they are preparing the wedding. All the creatures of the swamp get invited but not for a good reason. Maleficient's daughter finds the truth while almost all the creatures are being killed by the queen's assistant inside the church.  <br/> Maleficient's siblings go to the kingdom too to kill all the humans due to a hugehate caused by the humans' try of exterminating them.  <br/>  <br/> Maleficient's daughter gets locked up in her room by the guards and when everything seems to get lost Maleficient arrives and saves everyone.

Firstly, Chaplin is walking calmly when suddenly a lot of rubbish falls on him, then Chaplin decides to light a cigarrette with a match. Later, he finds a baby in the middle of the street, he doesn't know what to do so he starts to walk with the baby until he sees a woman with a baby carriage. Chaplin thinks that the baby is likely to belong to that woman so he puts the baby on the carriage but the woman gets angry and she tells him that the baby is not hers. Chaplin comes back to the street and he leaves the baby again on the floor but when he turns around, he bumps into a policeman and as a consequence he picks up the baby again. Chaplin, with a touch of humour, puts the baby on an unkown man's arms and he runs. The unkown man is now confussed but he finds the same carriage in which Chaplin had left the baby before. The man leaves the baby in the carriage like Chaplin and he goes. The upset woman, that has discovered the baby again in her carriage, sees Chaplin taking a walk so she believes that he was the guilty. The woman givesthe baby back to Chaplin.

At first, he is declared to be an 'ackward ass' because he seemed to fall at the very beginning after someone threw him some clothes. Afterwards, while he was walking, after he lighted himself a cigar, he found an orphan baby lying on the floor. He picked the baby up from the floor and walked to see if he could find the mother of the child. He saw a woman carrying another baby in a trolley so he could have thought this was the baby's mother, so he left the child within the trolley. However, the woman yelled at Chaplin, because she was not the mother and probably she could have guessed that Chaplin wanted to leave the baby with her. As Chaplin is rejected, he followed his path to try to leave the baby again on the floor, but a policeman appears just behind his back, so he decides to pick the baby up again as there would be consequences for him. He walked around desesperately so that he could find the parents, but unsuccessfully, he saw the woman again and decided to put the baby on the  trolley, but the woman discovered him and started kicking him until he fell on the floor.  Finally, he decided to sit down on the road and started to think about leaving the child there, but he read the note on the baby's blanket and thoughtfully, decided to keep the orphan after all.

Then it can be seen that there are various bricks or something similar falling down on him. But, it appear that someone has taken those objects intentionally to disturb the protagonist of the video. However, it can be elucidated that he does not worry. Therefore, he continues his path along the street. While the scene is happening it can be observed that there is a man next to Chaplin and talking to him. The words that the man is uttering are not distinguisable. Moreover, in the scene there are some break downs to show funny sentences commenting about the pictures. I think that in these comments the character tries to express his feelings. He appears to be careless about the missfotunes he is facing. Next, in the setting the main character finds a poor babby that has been left out in the suburbs. He catchs the baby with himand tries to put the baby in a woman's baby-cart. Consequentlu, the girl returns the unknown baby to Chaplin. She does the later with discontent. Following, it can be seen that Chaplin gives the baby to a random man that is near him. In the consequent scene, the same woman that has returned the baby comes to give back again the baby to Chaplin. Finally, Chaplin tries to throw the baby away. Notwithstanding, he finds a note that express the desire to find a person that takes cares of the baby and he decides to by like his father with affection.

Our protagonist is pretty concentrated in smoking his cigarette when he sees a baby who is crying on the floor. Charles Chaplin decides to place him in a nearby baby carriage of a woman who passes by, but she doesn’t want to take care of the baby so the woman is pretty mad after realizing it. Without any remaining clue about the parents of the newborn, Charles Chaplin returns the baby to his original spot. However, a policeman appears and he has to take the newborn again. The child keeps on crying, so our protagonist leaves him in the arms of an old man and runs back to hide in the first location, hoping to get rid of the baby. Unfortunately, the old man leaves the newborn in the same baby carriage in which Charles Chaplin had tried to leave him, so when the woman sees him again, attacks our protagonist with her umbrella, calling the attention of the policeman and forcing Charles Chaplin to take the baby again. Desperate, he sits down on the curb of the sidewalk, looking at a sewer to see if the newborn would fit in it, although he abandons that idea soon after. Suddenly, Charles Chaplin finds a note inside the clothes of the baby which says “Please love and care for this orphan child” and, moved by these sincere words, he finally decides to keep the newborn with him.

They are doing a filmed documentary about Norwegian landscape when, all of a sudden, they discover a bizarre man in a ban, and they start following him wherever he goes. The man tell the students that even he says he works as a plague controller, he’s indeed the one who holds off all the trolls over the Scandinavian countries. The film is a false documentary where the students are filming the hunter’s methods and instruments, and they film how the trolls behave in a natural environment, something the Government has tried to hide from the public eye. It’s a very interesting take on a “false documentary” with good 3D animation, and a really unique way to represent the Scandinavian and, more specifically, the Norwegian mythology.

The kid would even have googled if Google had been invented before that day. Instead of that, the dog and the kid went to the big forest. They called it from the distance, they searched it inside a tree, they looked for see it above the rocks, and everywhere in the forest. Suddenly, while the kid was searching, sitting on a rock, he and his dog were caught by a big deer, who threw them to the river nearby. Trying to survive, they jumped on an old trunk that fortunately decided to pass by them. At the other side of the trunk, they saw a green amphibious face which looked familiar to them, joined with other green unknown faces. ow, their frog, which wasn't feeling comfortable inside the glass vase where it was caught, was with its froggy family, living happily together, until they tried to cross the mad.

I went out with my dog to the forest, as the frog was likely to be out there. But, although I cried and cried, my frog did not show up. I was not going to give up that easy, so I continued with my search. I did not want to be at the forest at night, as the lack of lights scared me, so we had to hurry up. <br/> I climbed small trees, big trees; small rocks, big rocks; I shouted till I was almost voiceless, but I found nothing. Everything I was doing was in vain, and I started to feel tired and even frustrated.  <br/> However, Fortune always shows up in the most unpredictable moments; and, when I had lost the hope of finding my frog, I fell to lake and, right on the lake's shore, behind a big log, there was my frog! It seemed like it had found a group of frogs to be with, but I could not handle the fact of being separated of my frog, so I took it and carried it back home.  <br/> Now, I always close my window at night, I do not want it to run away anymore!

The main argument is about a girl and a boy that exchange their bodies while they are sleeping. The girl name is Mitsuha and she lives in a really small town in the north of Japan. The boy is called Taki and he lives in Tokyo, the capital. When they are aware that their bodies are being exchanged (and they are not dreaming) they decided to live notes for the other in order to help themselves not to attract too much attention to their unusual behavior. They will help each other to get over some problems in their lives. With time, connection between them wound grow more and more until they care more about the other.

Then, someone takes their trash out through the window aiming to a trash can that is on the street, but accidently  all the trash falls over Chaplin.  <br/> He then decides to lit a cigar, and in order to do so he first takes out his packet; chooses a cigar; puts his cane on his arm as to hold it properly while he lits the cigar; then, he takes off his gloves; takes a match from his pocket, and by scratching a match on his shoe Chaplin lits his cigar; takes the cane right back in his hands, and throws away his gloves.  <br/> Suddenly, Chaplin is interrupted by the cry of a baby that is near the trash cans, he looks at it closely and looks up as to see if someone had thrown him out through the window as with the trash. Chaplin decides to pick up the baby, and, as he does this, he sees a woman walking by pushing a stroller with a baby in it. Assuming that the woman is related to the baby he has just picked up, he calls upon her and decides to put the baby inside the stroller. Once the woman realizes what Chaplin had done she calls him off and Chaplin quickly decides to take back the baby. Both the lady and Chaplin walk away. <br/> Chaplin decides to put back the baby where he found it, near the trash cans. As he is doing this, a policeman stands right behind him, observing him. Right when Chaplin is about to walk  away from the baby he notices that the policeman has just seen him ""abandoning"" the baby, and rapidly understands that the policeman might misunderstand the situation and rushes back to pick him up.  <br/> In the next scene, we observe Chaplin walking away with the baby as he meets a man in the street. Chaplin decides to trick him by asking the man if he could hold the baby as he ties his shoes. When he starts tying his shoes and the man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin runs away. And when the man realizes what Chaplin is doing he starts chasing him. But, as he loses track of Chaplin, he decides to put the baby in the stroller Chaplin had previously put the baby and runs away. <br/> In the following scene, Chaplin gets out of his hiding place and as he goes out he encounters the policeman and he runs away. Then, the woman with the stroller sees Chaplin and figures that he was the one that had put bakc the baby in the stroller and decides to hit Chaplin with her umbrella until he feels obliged to pick the baby up once again.  <br/> In the last scene Chaplin is seen sitting with the baby and trying to decide what to do with him.

So, he has to catch the baby again. This time he lies to an old man to hold the baby and Chaplin runs away and hides from him. The old man tries to find Chaplin. As he does not do it, he leaves the baby in the baby carriage which we have seen before.  <br/> Chaplin comes out of hiding and finds the policeman again, so he takes another way. He walks next to the baby carriage and the woman follows him with an umbrella to hit him. They are arguing about the baby when the policeman appears.

In the film Harry meets Dobby, who tries to warn him of the dangers of going to Hogwarts that year, as Voldemort is closer to him and is in better shape since their last encounter, where he was just a face attached to one of Harry’s professors. Many of Harry’s friends are petrified along the film, until Harry manages to open the Chamber of Secrets and fights the Obelisk. He kills the Obelisk, that happens to be one of Voldemort’s horcruxes. In the end, all of Harry’s friends are brought back to life and Harry is ready for another year of trying to be killed by Voldemort.

He looks surprised but he picks up the baby and thinks what should he do with him. He tries to get rid of it but no matter what he does the baby seems to go back one way or the other to him. The first time he thinks someone dropped the baby but the woman, who already has a baby is suspicious of him trying to abandon his baby and so does the policeman afterwards. At the end he finds a letter saying to look after the baby who apparently is an orphan with no place to go.

This fragment has been taken from the movie 'The Kid', and I am going to sum up what I saw. <br/> Charles Chaplin was going through a street when suddenly he found a baby behind some trash bins. Not knowing what he should do, he starts to go around, with the baby on his arms, trying to find him a place to stay. But he realises that another baby's trolley, an old man's arms, or the same place where he found him, are not the best options, as there is a policeman around, and he does not want himself to be accused for something wrongly. At the end, desperated, he sits on the street and discovers that the baby has a note within his clothes which begs love and care as he is orphan. So Chaplin, apparently, takes care about this poor baby and takes him home.

It is black and white and the only sound to hear is the music that follows the actions of the characters. The few times we can ""hear"", actually reading"" what they may say, is in slides that occationally appear. The protagonist, who walks in a silly way along a street, feels anoyed when someone throws things, through the window in the building next to him, and as a consecuence, hitting him. After that, he stops to relax and looks for a cigarrette to smoke. He burns it and start to smoke. Then, he finds an orphan baby and looks for his parents. At the same time, a woman carrying her own baby passes by and the protagonist, who thought that he might be the baby's mother, puts him next to the other baby in the babycar but the woman refuses to keep it since it was not hers. Next, the protagonist thinks of leaving the baby where he found it but a policeofficer enters and the obviously couldn't leave the baby. Looking for another option, he sees another man walking and asks hi to hold the baby while he ""mends a problem he had with his shoes"" but runs away leaving the baby with that man. Now it is his problem. However, that man did not know what to do either and found the same babycar with the previous baby in front of a shop and leaves it there. Then, the mother goes out and finds the baby next to hers and tries to find the person who left him there, when the protagonist appears again and the woman, very agressively, gives the child to him again. He doesn't know what to do and sits on the street. He tthinks on leaving the baby underground but he refuses the idea. Finally, the finds a letter in the baby's clothes telling to whoever would find him to love and take care of that orphan child. The protagonit happily stands up and goes away with, now, his own baby."

He begins to analyse the situation and looking everywhere because leaving a baby in the street is a very cruel act. While he is taking the baby with him, there is a woman with a baby carriage walking behind him. Chaplin sees her so he walks towards her with the intention of leaving her the baby. He leaves the baby in the carriage and the woman beings to argue with him because the baby is not hers; therefore, Charles has to take the baby with him again and wants to leave him in the place where he found him.

When Chaplin sees the officer behind him, he quickly takes the baby with him again and starts walking down the street. He runs into a man and gives him the baby with the excuse that he needs to tie his shoes, so he is pretending he is doing that when all of a sudden he runs away.

The policeman observes the situation and the woman argues with him and with Chaplin, so he is forced to take the baby with again. He sits down in the pavement next to a sewer and watches it with the intention of leaving the baby there, but finally he does ot do that.

At first, it was difficult for her to get used to the new lifestyle that was presented before her, though she gradually becomes part of the royal family and begins to enjoy the luxury that such a life can bring to the table. However, an excessively expensive lifestyle and the vice of gambling plus many bad decisions that the monarchs had made, eventually provoked a great loss of wealth that the French people do not tolerate.

But the women sees the action of Chaplin and she says to him that she doesn't want to take care his baby. Chaplin takes the baby again and, now, he decides to put on the same place that he has found it. However, a policeman sees him doing this and he has to take it and go away with him. Suddenly, he sees a man that is walking around on the street. He thinks that it is a good idea to ask him if it is possible that he held the baby one second while he puts on his shoes. He does it, but he starts to run away when the boy is helding the baby. This boy realises that Chaplin has lied him and he decides the same that Chaplin had decided it before: put the baby in the ""baby car"" of the other woman. When the woman sees the baby again, she looks for Chaplin and starts to hit him with the umbrella. In that moment, the policeman appears again and Chaplin and the woman stop. The video ends with Chaplin reading a piece of paper that is found on the baby clothes. In that note Chaplin reads that he has to take care the baby like it was his baby. So he decides to do it."

It shows the beginning of the fascist movement in Spain, seen from Miguel de Unamuno's persperctive, a well-known writer who was in charge of the University of Salamanca. He does not share the ideólogy of the new movement but defend it as being as bad as the republic one. However, the disappearance of his friends led him to meet personally the leader of the fascists to ask him to find them or to liberate them, but to no avail. Consequently, as he was invited to give a speech for them for being an intelectual person, he decided to attack their system and the unfair violence employed in it. He almost got killed but he was saved in the last moment by Franco's woman, who was an admirer of his texts."

Although I was not eager to watch it, as Spanish films do not tend to meet my expectations, I finally decided to give it a chance. <br/> The cast was definetely amazing: Mario Casas, José Coronado, Bárbara Lennie... In fact, they all are definetely talented actors. Besides, the plot was so interesting and extremely addictive. It all starts when a couple (Adrián Doria and Laura Vidal, his lover), has an accident in the middle of a forest. They accidentally kill a boy, who was coming back home in that precise moment. Both of them start to panic, as they see how their lifes might dramatically change just because of a traffic accident which was not even their fault, since it was all provoked by a deer's jump. Laura decides to avoid phoning the police and solve the problem themselves. She asks Adrián to shed the cadaver and he obbeys her. <br/> While Adrián looks for a place to get rid of the boy, Laura asks for help. A man who had been driving over there, finds her and invites her home in order to repair her car. She accepts and a succession of strange events, which I will not reveal so you can enjoy this amazing film, start happening from this point on. <br/> At the beginning, the film seems not to have any sense at all, but it reminded me of a puzzle: every single detail is relevant and everything gains meaning. <br/> Have you ever thought about your life? Have you ever considered destiny as a relevant factor in your life? All these questions and some others are answered in the film. Furthermore, it really made me reflect about how easy is to lose it all just because of small details. Every decision has its consequences, which can turn your life from a paradise to a hell."

As strange as its title, Big Fish is about Edward Bloom adventures along his life. This comes because Edward was at the end of his life and he and his son didn't talk to each other for the last 3 years, since Will, his son, hated that his father was always talking about a legendary fish that lived in the river near their town and nobody was able to catch it but him the day Will was born. His father always took the protagonism so Will was full of this and their relationship cooled down. Along the film, Edward talks about his life and everything is like a fantasy world, since when a story ends, Will always says that he invented almost the entire story. Edward says he met a witch, a man who was 3 meters tall, he worked in a circus, etc. He also tells the story of how he met Will's mother, the love of his life. By the end of the film, Will realices that he loves his father and that the legendary fish is somehow is father, since even if it was impossible to catch (he was a wild soul all his life) when he was born the fish was catched by him (having a kid made him settle down and realice how much he loved his son). It's a bizarre film, worth of watching if you don't have anything better to do, nice to see in a moment of boredom.

He carries the baby through an alley and sits down. He hesitates what to do with the little one, but then he finds a paper note that triggers his feelings. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". He smiles and takes the baby in his hands."

It is a Netflix film which is basically about a girl (Lara Jean) who has been writing secret love letters addressing boys from her high school. Her sister discovers the letters and sends them to the boys without telling Lara. When they read the letters, they seem to be very surprised and start to care about her. Moreover, she starts a fake relationship with one of the boys, just to show that she is not in love with the rest of them. In conclusion, I would say that although it is a predictable teen film, I found it very original and it also made me think about how young people express their emotions through writing.

Film	written_online	30	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English), Monolingual dictionary	The Thirteen Roses (Las Trece Rosas) is a historical drama  about the fight, imprisonment and later execution of thirteen republican women during the first year of the Spanish post-war period. After having won the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) Francisco Franco established a dictatorship, in which the first years were tremendously violent for those who didn't share his ideologies. Nevertheless none of these facts could discourage the thirteen roses, who fought for their beliefs until the very end of their lives. <br/>  <br/> Despite their young  age - most of them were under-age, these women fought and worked secretly for the reinstatement of the Spanish Republic and against the dictatorship regime recently set up. They were therefore arrested and jailed and it is during the wait for their trial that they all meet. Meanwhile a macabre process of interrogation in which human rights are clearly attacked takes place. Moreover the vulnerability of life during these periods is clarified; one of the prosecuted is a fascist side defender but faces the same destiny after being caught hiding at her home a friend of hers, a sympathizer of the Republic. <br/>  <br/> The movie is a representation of one of the darkest chapters in Spanish history. It is a moving story that brings the onlooker to tears, feeling anger, impotence and hence making it impossible not to  put themselves in the protagonists' shoes. In my opinion, a marvellous film.

In order to do so, they need to send a pilot to a black hole, hoping that he can jump on time and fix the situation that led to such a complicated scenario. The pilot chosen to do that task is a marine veteran now converted into a farmer, who lives with her father and his two daughters. At first, he is reluctant to go, but he finally accepts when he realizes that if the situation doesn't change they will starve anyway. While he is in space, time flows differently on earth, and he has to see how his children grow up without him and go through complicated times, which makes him go into a state of mind in which he can hardly differentiate reality from fiction. In the end, he manages to reunite with his daughter, who is now an old woman in the verge of death, while he is only a few years older than when he departed earth.

The teacher asked the children to change the world. For that reason, this was a task for the children to complete along the whole year. However, the teacher didn't expected what the little boy was going to do.  <br/>  <br/> This kid lived with his mother, who had alcohol problems. His father left them, but sometimes he returned. The boy hated when his father came home because he hit his mother. <br/>  <br/> Thinking about the task proposed by his teacher, the kid designed a method to change the world. It was like a chain of favours. Following this chain, you have to do something for three people, and these people have to do the same with another three, and so on and so forth. <br/>  <br/> Although thinking the boy's idea was brilliant, anyone expected it to really change the world. However, this chain of favours worked out pretty well and many people heard of it and participate. Thus, even the press wanted to know the origin of this movement of kindness, and a periodist found the boy.  The periodist interviewed the child and he told everyone about his idea through television. <br/>  <br/> But this boy had a challenge. Several times he had seen how other children were hitting one of his friends and he could do nothing to help him because he was frightened. But one day, when he saw one of this scenes, he was brave and he tried to help his friend. Sadly, while fighting with one of the violent children, he was hurt by a knife. He end up in the hospital but nothing could be done to save his life. He was angel. His life was short but quite meaningful, since he changed many people's lives.

It is composed by Mr.Bennet, Mrs.Bennet and their five daughters. They live a normal life until the arrival of Mr.Bingley in the town. He comes along with the presence of his sister and Mr.Darcy.

Later on, he saw a woman carrying another baby and while the woman entered a shop, he put the child he found in the trolley next to the woman's baby. When the woman left the shop and found the child, she became surprised and returned the strange baby to the man. As he didn't know what to do with the baby, he decided to leave the child where he saw him/her for the first time. Nevertheless, a police officer appeared and probably thought that the poor man was trying to get rid of his own baby so, he had to keep the child with him. Chaplin was thinking about a possible manner of leaving the baby without causing him/her any harm when he saw a man wandering. Even though the man seemed to be homeless, Chaplin gave him the baby because he was unwilling to have a child's responsibility. The homeless man saw the woman again so, he thought as Chaplin did and ran away. Few seconds later, while Chaplin was walking nearby, both the officer and the woman recognised him as the man who carried the baby before and gave the baby back to him. Eventually, he decided to sit a little bit as he got so confused that he didn't know where to go with the baby.

Suddlenly, he sees something on the ground; he finds it is a baby wrapped in clothes. He is overwhelmed and tries to leave the baby in a baby trolley. The woman, probably the mother, returns the baby to him. A police officer is walking around at the same time, making sure that everything is alright. As a last resort, he gives the baby to an old man walking around and flees; unluckily, this man tries to put the baby in the same trolley as the beginning and the woman, once again, returns it to the protagonist. At the end, the man debates between accepting the newfound orphan baby and abandon him once again, this time permanently. This baby has its story told since the beginning, its fate is written. That person will grow without the love of a family to whom he is no burden to; that person will have a very difficult future. And no one cares. Not the maternal figure, represented in the woman, who has a baby herself. Not the policeman, who subtly wants the man to keep the orphan because it would be easier than doing it himself. Not its parents, that are absent and just leave a note asking someone to take care of their child. And, of course, not the protagonist, who finds himself between the road of empaty or selfishness. And at the end, so do all of us.

When he gets out, he sees some wreckage falling down the first floor. He starts shouting. Then, he takes a butt from his pocket to smoke.  <br/> Suddenly, he sees a baby crying on the floor. The little boy is completely alone. Chaplin takes the baby into his arms and looks for his mother. He sees a woman carrying a baby trolley and he puts the baby there. As the woman is not his mother, she tells him what is happening. She is fairly angry. Chaplin takes the baby and the woman leaves. In that moment, a police officer appears and he sees Chaplin putting the baby on the floor, next to a rubbish bin. The police officer tells him something like “what are you doing?” Therefore, Chaplin very scared, takes the baby again and leaves the place. While he is on his way, Chaplin finds an old man. He gives the baby to the old man and runs away from there. The old man looks for Chaplin because he doesn't want to care for the baby. As this man doesn't find him, he leaves the baby in the baby trolley again. When the woman realises what has happened, she goes nuts. She finds Chaplin and she starts hitting him with an umbrella.  <br/> At this time, the police officer appears again and the woman explains to him the problem. Chaplin takes the baby and he sits on the pavement. Chaplin hugs the little boy and he discovers a little piece of paper hidden in the baby’s blanket. It’s a note which says “please love and care for this orphan child”. He realises that the little boy doesn't have parents and he tightly hugs him. Finally, both people, the baby and Chaplin, leave the scene.

It is a beautiful British production based on one of Vera Brittain's novels. Both the film and the novel share the same title, which may give some light about the content of the film.  <br/> As one can infer, ""Testament of Youth"" relates the experiences of a young girl who has to live the dramatic experience of a war. This young girl is called Vera Brittain and she is an independent, intelligent and advanced teenager whose thoughts are ahead of her time. She wants to study, go to college and become a writer. These ideas are not very well regarded by her paprents. One summer, she meets two of her brother's friends and they all begin a good friendship, sharing many moments together.  <br/> After getting parental approaval, Vera sits the college entrance exams and, although it does not go as well as it could, she gets a possition. During that period she sends and receives letters with one of his brother's friends, Ronald Leighton, with whom she starts a love relationship. However, later on that year, the First World War breaks and his brother and his two good friends enroll in the army.  <br/> She cannot stand the idea of having them fighting in the war while she is studying in Oxford. Thus, she decides to become a volunteer nurse. She starts attending injured soldiers in England when Ronald and she become engaged. They are about to get married when the chosen day a terrible call is received. Ronald has died on the battle fields. Later on, she attends her other friend, who has been seriously injured. Despite her many cares, he also died. Broken hearted, Vera decides to go to the nursing tents in the front as she cannnot stand the idea of remaining at home when her beloved  brother and many other young men are fighting. She attends not only Brittish soldiers but also German enemies in their last minutes. One day, she finds out that one of the dying soldiers is her brother. After her many cares, he survives and comes back to the battel fields when he is totally recovered.  <br/> A bit later, while Vera is at home visiting her parents, a tragic letter arrives home. Her loved brother has died while fighting a few days before the end of the war is declared.  <br/> Broken inside, she comes back to Oxford and continues with her studies. One day, she attends a political meeting where she speaks out loud about her experiences in war and the need for peace in the world. This is the starting point of her future acions as a pacifist."

He picks up the baby, and tries to give it to a woman passing by with her own baby. The woman rejects taking care of the baby so Chaplin picks it up again, and tries to return it to the previous place where he found it. However, a police officer catches him in the act so he picks up the baby one more time. Going down the street, Chaplin sees a man and tricks him to hold the baby while Chaplin ties his boots so that he could get out of there without the baby. This man, trying to find Chaplin, sees the same baby carriage where Chaplin had unsuccessfully left the baby the first time, and leaves it there. The woman, furious about this, tries to find a solution when, unfortunately for Chaplin, he passes by in front of the woman. She chases him with an umbrella to pick the baby and carries it with him. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby since anyone else is willing to do it.

At first, we can see Charles wandering around a poor neighbourhood, when all of a sudden a pile of rubbish is thrown at him. He does not take this into account and proceeds to light up a cigar. Suddenly, he notices that a baby is lying in the ground. Since a woman is walking by with her child, Charles thinks that the baby he has just found is hers. Therefore, he places the baby in the stroller. Nevertheless, she responds angry to Charles owing to the fact that the baby does not belong to her. As a result, he has to take the baby again with him and decides to leave him back in the place where he found him. However, a policeman discovers what Charles aims to do. Despite the fact that he cannot leave the baby there, he eventually finds a man who he asks to hold the baby for a second, which gives Charles time to escape. This man chases Chaplin but he finds a stroller, where he leaves the baby. Charles comes out of the place in which he had hidden and finds the policeman, so he has to run away again. Nevertheless, Charles passes by the stroller and the same woman he had previously encountered tells him furiously that the baby is not hers. Consequently, he has to take the baby. Finally, Charles sits on the ground holding the baby when all of a sudden he finds a piece of paper in which it is asked to please take care and love the poor child. In the end, he decides to take the baby with him and love him.

One day, the frog decided to leave, and after getting its little luggage ready, it parted. The kid and the dog were worried sick and decided to go look for it. They now felt lonely without it, it was an important part of their lives. After hours and hours of non-stopping screams and legs ache, a doe pushed the kid down a small edge which lead to a swap. He then found the frog there. He wanted it back but... he didn't even think about looking for it there, its perfect habitat. So, the frog argued that it didn't feel loved or considered and that it had made its decision. Goodbye.

In spite of his worn-out clothes, he looks pretty classy and elegant: he is wearing a black suit and a bowler hat, and also uses a cane. After having been beaten by some rubbish that have fallen from a window, he searches for a cigar, takes one of the fag-ends that he keeps in a cigarette case, and, after taking off his ragged gloves, he lights it with a match and throw the gloves away. Suddenly, the tramp finds a baby who is weeping desperately on the floor next to some bins.  <br/>   <br/> He picks him up and looks up to see if the baby has fallen from a window too. Then, a woman with a pram passes in front of them and the tramp runs to her to give her the baby, since he thinks she has dropped him accidentally. The woman, who already has a baby of her own, seems to be really upset with the tramp and tells him that that baby is not hers, so the tramp takes him back and put him in the same spot where he found him. However, a police officer is just behind him and the tramp picks up the baby again from the floor. After that, he asks a bearded man to hold the baby for a moment so he can lace his shoe, but that is just a trick to get rid of him and run away. Next, the bearded man follows the tramp to give the baby back to him, but does not find him and puts the baby in the woman’s pram instead. When the woman finds that the tramp’s baby is in her pram again, she hits him with her umbrella, the police officer arrives and she accuses the tramp of abandoning the baby, so he takes him back.  <br/>  <br/> The tramp does not know what to do with the baby. He sits on the sidewalk for a moment and thinks of dropping him in the gutter, but repents of it. Then, the tramp finds a note hidden in the baby’s clothes: it asks whoever who find the baby to love and take care of him. After reading the note, the tramp smiles cheerfully at the baby and walks away with him.

But what he didn't know it was that, during the night, the frog had escaped from the jar; so when the boy woke up and saw the empty jar in front of him, he decided to go search the  frog outside. He went to the forest with his dog, where he looked and search in th trees, he even got on a top of a big rock, but unfortunately there was a male deer  hiding in some bushes behind it, so the deer took the little boy on his snout and horns and then he dropped him into a pond that was nearby. The poor kid tried his best to get out of the water, and so did his dog. They used a trunk that was close to help them getting out and as soon he leaned over it, he found the frog, and not just the frog, all the frog's family was living in the pond. That's how he realised he had to leave the frog with its family, so he smiled and waved goodbye while heading back home with his dog.

Their father gets a case to defend a black person, but he fails to prevent him from being convicted, declared guilty. This person is finally killed in prison. The children are very affected by this situation, since they have good hearts and know that the black person was actually innocent, so when the jury declared him guilty they felt that they didn't do justice. There is another plot line that is important in the story. The kids are interested in one of their neighbours who seems to be described as a mysterious and evil person, but they end up discovering that he is a good person and he even saves their lives. So we can say that both the black person and this neighbour are mockingbirds becasue they don't hurt anyone and are good people.

Bothered by the situation, he takes a cigarette from his case and looks around him trying to find the responsible of that action. While he is looking, he notices that, behind him, there is an abandoned baby lying on the floor. A confused Chaplin distinguishes a woman walking down the street with a baby stroller and, therefore, he runs towards her leaving the baby in the troller. When the lady notices about this, she gets mad since she does not recognise the baby. Chaplin and the woman argue and rapidly he comes back with the baby to the place where he found it. Then, he leaves the child again on the floor abandoning it. However, when he tries to escape, a policeman witnesses him. Chaplin takes again the baby and runs. During the chase, he leaves the baby with an old man but, subsequently, the old man leaves the baby with the aforementioned woman and then disappears. Unfortunately for Chaplin, the woman sees him again and assumes that he is the one who has left the baby in the stroller, then the woman, violently, punches him. Chaplin is forced again to take the baby and run. Apparently exhausted, he sits down in the pavement holding the child. Then he notices that within the baby’s clothes there is a note with a message that confirms that the baby is an orphan child. Finally, he opts to adopt it.

However, when they start playing the game that entitles the film, some secrets are discovered, and their lives are more related than firstly expected. The two boys had a sexual affair although they were secretly in love and the girl who was the third flatmate was also in love with one of the guys.

Later, when he saw a mother with a buggy and her baby, Chaplin thought the baby he found could probably be hers and put him on that same buggy, but the woman said it was not hers and Chaplin took the baby back again. Thus, he tried to leave this kid back on the floor but he picked him up as soon as he noticed there was a police near him. Worried because of having this small kid, he convinced a man to take him/her for a while while he fled. Unfortunately for Chaplin, this man put the baby back on the mother's buggy without being caught by anyone. Hence, when the mother saw Chaplin again, she made him to take the baby out of his buggy. Finally, this hopeless Chaplin, sat down with the kid on his arms, realized that this was an abandoned baby left with a note. After reading it, Chaplin changed his mind about the baby and we can imagine that he looked after the baby as the paper he read only asked for this baby to be loved as he had been abandoned.

He stops to take a cigarette out of a case and, suddenly, he sees a baby lying on the floor. He picks up the child and realises that, behind him, there is a lady pushing around a pram. Chaplin thinks that the baby must be one of her children and tries to place him in the pram. The lady reacts furiously and obliges him to take his child away.  <br/> Not knowing what to do, Chaplin comes back to where he found the baby and attempts to leave him there again. However, a policeman appears and he is forced to take the baby with him. He decides then to give it to a bearded man who was passing by. The man, who suddenly realised that Chaplin was running away, also tries to get rid of the baby by putting him inside the pram of the woman mentioned before. By chance, she left the stroller unattended while making an errand, so the bearded man has the opportunity to leave the baby in the pram and run away.  <br/> Chaplin, who thinks that he finally could get rid of the baby, passes by the pram when the lady is finding out that she has two babies instead of one. Again she blames Chaplin and starts hitting him with her umbrella until he takes the baby with him and goes away.  <br/> He is despaired up to the point of considering leaving the child in a drain. After discarding that option, he realises that there is a note among the baby's clothes. It says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

These citizens who are carrying out this activity are neither aware nor worried about the fact that anyone might be passing by. We are shown this evidence as Chaplin avoids the first one but ends up being thrown the garbage of another person. After this event, which provoked his cigarette falling down, he decides to take another and start to smoke it. This having been done, he finds a baby left on the floor. At first, he thinks he might have been dropped from one of the windows by accident. When he sees a woman with a cart and baby, he thinks the child is hers, so he goes closer to her and tries to leave him in the cart. However, the woman appears after having left the cart and tells him that he is not her son. <br/> Then, he returns to the place where he found him and tries to abandon him, but a policeman shows up. When Chaplin realises that he has witnessed his act, he takes the baby again and leaves.  <br/> Now in another street, Chaplin finds an old man and thinks this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of the baby. Then, he lies to the man and runs away as the old man shouts at him. Chaplin having left, the man moves on to another street with the baby, where he finds the cart of the woman seen before in the movie, and leaves the child there. At this moment, Chaplin, who thought everything was over, reappears, but he is noticed by the woman, who has discovered the unknown baby in her chart. She then hits him and tells him off because she thought he had been the one who had left the baby in the cart. <br/> After this funny episode, Chaplin moves on to another place of the city and sits down on the pavement. When examining the child, he finds out a piece of paper, where he reads that the author begs of the person who found the child love and care towards him. Eventually, he decides to look after the child and the film ends.

Suddenly, he finds a baby on the floor, looks around, and sees no one, so he decides to pick the baby up. He walks holding the baby and sees a woman who appears to be looking for something, and Chaplin puts the baby he had found on the woman's trolley, in front of the woman's child that was already on it. However, it seems the baby found by Chaplin is not the one the woman was looking for, so she reacts violently against him and makes him go away with the baby. Then, Chaplin decides to leave it where he found it, but, right when he was about to do so, a police officer appears and Chaplin has no option but to pick it up again to avoid having problems with the police man. Chaplin then walks again holding the baby, and to get rid of it, he tricks an old man pretending he ties his shoes while Chaplin makes him hold the baby, but runs away insted. Due to a series of some funny coincidences, Chaplin has problems again with the woman he had met before, and with the police man as well. Next, he sits on the sidewalk, thinking what to do, and finds a note within the baby's clothes that says it is an orphan baby. Eventually, he realises the baby has no home or family, and that it is not lost, and he finally decides to keep it.

After that, he gets out of his pocket a metal box from which he takes a cigarrette end that he lights and starts to smoke. He intends to continue walking, but a baby wrapped in sheets calls his attention. He takes the child in his arms and thinks what to do while a woman passes by with a baby trolley and goes towards her, thinking that was her baby. But it wasn't, so the woman angrily tells him to take the kid and go and so does Chaplin. His next idea is to leave the kid in the same spot he found him, so whoever had lost him could find him, but a police officer sees him and thinks he is abandoning the baby so he takes him again and leaves. Desperate, he finds a man to whom he asks to grab the baby and, while he pretends to tie his shoelaces, runs away and hides. At the same time, the other man leaves the baby in a baby trolley he finds in the street, which is by chance the same woman's one. Chaplin gets out of his hideout and when the woman sees him, she hits him repeatedly and starts arguing with him to take the child. In that moment, the policeman comes and Chaplin is forced to take the baby again. At the end Chaplin sits to think what to do and finds between the baby's sheets a note asking to take care of him since he is an orphan. Chaplin gets up and finally walks away with the baby.

As he doesn't find anybody, he leaves the baby in a pram he notices. But the pram's woman complains and holds him the baby again. He tries to abandon it on the street, where he found it, but a police man sees him, so he tries to escape, not to get caught by the police man. After that, he leaves the baby with a man, who puts the baby into the previously mentioned pram, and the pram's woman gives the baby to Chaplin for a second time. Eventually, Chaplin sits down and looks at the baby while holding it, when he notices about a hidden paper in the baby clothes. He takes it and reads the message written: the baby is an orphan kid. Chaplin smiles.

Chaplin	written_online	30	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	At the beginning of the video we see Chaplin walking in a relay dirty street where people seem to be throwing rubbish from the windows of the buildings.  As he keeps walking some of the rubbish falls on him. He opens a metal box in which we see several almost finished cigars. He chooses one and lights it. At some point he sees a baby laying on the floor, next to more rubbish. He is quite surprised and looks at the windows wondering if anybody has thrown the baby from a window. He takes the baby in his arms and tries to figure out what to do with it. Then, when a woman with a stroller passes by, Chaplin leaves the baby inside the stroller. However, as soon as the woman realises this, she scolds him and Chaplin has to take the baby again. Later on, he tries to leave the baby on the floor where he had found it but the presence of a police man makes him keep the baby. After that, he tricks someone to hold the baby and runs away. This man who is now holding the child decides to leave it in the same stroller as Chaplin did before. Hence, when the woman with the stoller sees Chaplin, she beats him up and returns the baby to him (now Chaplin cannot get rid of the baby as the same police officer is watching him).  At the end Chaplin sits in the street beside a sewer with the baby in his arms. He watches the gutter considering if the baby would fit in there but decides to keep it in his arms. When he is looking at the baby, he finds some money and a letter in its clothes. The letter says “Please love and care for this orphan child”. So, we see how Caplin gets emotional and decides to keep the baby. He gets up with a smile on his face and leaves.

Even if it is graphic and maybe not too suitable for a sensitive audience, it really shows a cruel reality still existent in modern day: fascism and racism. Even if some people don't see it like a modern problem, fascism is still present in our daily life's and it is gaining more and more power because of hateful politics. This film is a good example of how following past mistakes will only bring us more mistakes.

Film	written_online	20	Inside classroom	""	The most recent film I watched is Matrix. Mr. Anderson, the main character, seems to represent the typical office worker that wears grey clothes, lives on pre-cooked food and doesn't have much of a social life. In fact, he doesn't have a life at all. He embodies the realization that the so-called american dream is a rat trap, in which we all run inside a wheel day after day in order to make the system work, and believe we enjoy free will. That is actually both the introduction and the following 2-hour development. The actual plot is a dystopia set in 2199 in which the world has been completely destroyed after a war between men kind and artificial intelligence. Finally, robots took control of the world and now grow humans and connect them to a system that gathers their energy in order to feed themselves. Meanwhile, humans are unaware of their condition and believe to be living in 1999, which is actually a digital projection programmed by robots and introduced in the human brain through wires. I believe this is a metaphor of the afore-mentioned 'rat trap' and therefore a critical view towards our reality.

He stopped to light a cigar and, when he was about to leave, he saw a baby next to the trashcan. He decided to pick it up and find the person who had left him there. In that moment, a woman with a baby stroller was passing by, and he thought that it was hers', so he walked to her and left it in there. However, it wasn't hers', and she started yelling at him. He decided to run with the baby and leave it where he found it, but the police showed up at that moment and he had to pick it up again. As he saw that there was no way to leave it behind, he decided to trick an old man by asking him to grab the baby while he tied his shoes, and then run away. The old man found the woman Chaplin had seen before and left the baby in her stroller again. When Chaplin thought the problem was solved, he passed by the woman again, and she called the police, so he had to take the baby again. Hopeless, he sat in the street walk and thought about dropping him in the sewer, but then he found a note in the baby's blanket. He then realized that he was alone in the world and that it was destiny that put it in his life.

Suddenly, while he is walking through an alley, some debris falls from a building. He shakes off the dirt from his clothes and lights on a cigarette. While doing so, he finds a baby on the floor. Confused, he picks up the baby. He sees a woman passing by with a baby trolley for twins, so he decides to put the baby he has found next to the woman's. When she sees him doing so, she yells at him and tells him to take that baby away. He decides to put the baby back where he found him, in the alley, but he realises there is a policeman looking at him, so he takes it back from the street again. He sees a lame man using a walking stick passing by, and with the excuse that he is going to tie up his shoelaces, he gives the baby to the man, and then runs away. The man runs after him, but Charles Chaplin hides so he doesn't see him. The man then sees the same baby trolley Chaplin had seen before, and decides to put the baby there. The woman realises the baby is there again, and coincidentally Chaplin is passing by, so she yells at him. The policeman sees the two of them arguing so he goes to bring peace. Charles Chaplin is forced to take the baby again. Not knowing what to do with him, he sits on the sidewalk and considers throwing the baby down the drain, but does not do so in the end. He finds a paper between the baby clothes that reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. So, in the end, moved by that note, he decides to keep the baby.

As he is grunting about what has just happened, he takes a cigarette butt out of the tin box he keeps in his pocket. After taking his gloves off, he lights a matchstick with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking the butt. When he is about to set his journey again, his attention is driven to a baby lying on the floor, all wrapped up in blankets. He then sees a woman with a stroller, and he decides to follow her carting the baby in his arms. He tries to make the woman believe that she has dropped the baby out od the stroller, but she does not seem very convinced about that idea as she starts yelling at Chaplin. Then he returns to the same place the flowerpot landed on and he restored the baby to where he found him or her.  <br/>  <br/> At that very moment, a police officer sees Chaplin leaving the baby behind and so Chaplin decides to take the baby with him. As he strolls down the road, he pretends to need to lace his shoes and he entrusts the baby to a man in the street. When that man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin escapes and hides from the man who is chasing him. This latter man also sees that very same woman from before and leaves the baby in the stroller once again, but the woman thinks that it was Chaplin who put the baby inside the stroller and not the bearded man. After being beaten up with an umbrella, Chaplin takes the baby once more, but this time under the watchful eye of the police officer and he leaves.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin, resigned, sits down on the pavement, and takes a letter from the wrapped baby. The letter says: “Please love and care for this orphan child”. It seems that Chaplin was moved by this short note as he leaves with the baby in his arms.

Then, Chaplin takes the baby back to the place where he found him and leaves him on the floor. While he is leaving the baby, a policeman is watching him, so Chaplin takes the child back. Following this, he starts walking again holding the baby. He gives the creature to an old man, pretending he is going to lace his shoes, and runs away. This old man, confused as well, leaves the baby in the buggy again and he goes away. The mother comes out and looks surprised at the child. Then, she sees Chaplin walking by and assumes he was the one who left the baby again, so she hits him with an umbrella. The policeman comes and Chaplin ends up taking the baby. He sits on the floor while holding the child and thinks of putting him into a drain. Afterwards, he reads a note the baby had in his blanket. It sort of touches him and thus, he finally decides to take care of him.

Suddenly, someone throws rubbish to him from above. He stops, swears at the person above and takes a can out of his pocket that contains several half-smoked cigars. He takes one, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and throws his gloves to the bin. He looks to the left to discover a crying baby who has been abandoned on the street. He approaches and checks on him. Then, he looks at the surrounding buildings looking for the possible parents of the child. After seeing nobody, he decides to grab him while a woman with a trolley passes by. Chaplin notices the woman and chases her. When the woman stops to enter one of the houses, Chaplin leaves the child on the woman’s trolley just to see her come back yelling at Chaplin. The woman tells Chaplin, very angrily, that the baby is not hers, so Chaplin grabs the baby again and the woman leaves. Chaplin returns to where he found the baby and leaves him/her there again. When he turns around, he bumps into an officer and immediately turns around to take the baby and leave. As he is walking by, he sees an old man walking with a stick. Chaplin tells the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoe. When the man holds the baby, Chaplin pretends to tie his left shoe and a second after he runs away, leaving the man with the baby. The man chases Chaplin, who hides in a small room next to where the baby was found. The old man, not being able to find Chaplin, leaves the baby on the woman’s trolley. Chaplin exits the room where he was hiding and comes across another officer. He turns around and leaves. In the next scene, two people walk by the trolley and the woman goes out of the shop. The woman sees the baby on the trolley and shows herself incredulously. Chaplin passes by the woman, who takes an umbrella and runs to him. She starts to beat him with the umbrella. She grabs him by the jacket and takes him to the trolley. They start an argument about the baby and the woman calls an officer. The woman explains the situation to the officer and Chaplin takes the baby again, without the officer telling him to. They all leave. Chaplin walks on the sidewalk and drops his stick next to a drain. Then, he sits on the sidewalk to pick up the stick. He opens the drain and looks at the baby, thinking about dropping him inside. He frowns and closes the drain. He stares at the baby and starts talking to him/her. When the changes the baby to his right lap, Chaplin stabs himself with a pin that is on the baby’s blanket. He looks into the folds of the blanket and finds a note, which was held with the pin. He takes out the note and pokes the pin on his blazer.

Throughout the movie, he suffers from a severe reality dissociation  syndrome that makes him imagine situations that have not happened in real life as to the point he believes someone famous is his father.

Although their upbringing may have been tumultuous, they have always achieved their goals by striving. They had no option but to face their fears, and so they did. Among those who deserve to be praised, there is one who sticks out from the rest: Nelson Mandela.  <br/>  <br/> Nelson Mandela is widely known to have lead SouthAfrica to freedom and democracy. It was because of his effort and beliefs that the Apartheid was demolished and racism in SouthAfrica came to an end.  <br/>  <br/> Nelson Mandela had been imprisoned for almost 30 years, but suddenly the revolution began as an outbreak of rioting and Mandela was released from prison. However, he detached himself from these violent events by finishing them with his peaceful words and assertions. He was so praiseworthy a man that he did not take revenge on the former leaders of the country for having despised the black community, but he invited them to join forces with him to make a new country instead.  <br/>  <br/> Something that makes him the most praiseworthy man is that he always made the most of his leadership so as to fight for everyone in his country. He also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. But he won something better than that. He won the respect and praise of everyone in the world. That is why I consider him as the most praiseworthy man in history.

The man found the woman with the baby cart and left the baby there. Then, Chaplin walked next to the baby cart and the woman and the police officer saw him so he took the baby back again. Finally, Chaplin sat next to a sewer and found a note inside the baby’s clothes and decided that the baby would stay with him.

First of all, it is a silent and black and white film which was a very typical thing in those years. The scene stars with Chaplin in the street where he found a baby lying on the floor. Then, a policeman thought that the baby belonged to Chaplin so he had to pick up the baby from the floor. After a while, Chaplin tried many times to get rid of the baby but he did not. Eventually, he found a note where said that the baby was an orphan one, so he decided to take care of him. Through the whole scene, it can be seen that the first option for the actor is to leave the baby wherever. Besides, the first part is more like a comedian one, although when he realised that is an orphan child, the scene is more dramatic.

The plot centers on Rose's and Jack's love story aboard the Titanic. Both Jack and Rose fell in love at first sight; however, their story was not meant to exist: Rose was about to get married to a rich man, Carl, who would pay for all of her father's debts.  <br/>  <br/> It was several days after the departure of the ship when they first met. One night, Rose was having dinner, and decided to leave the room and run towards the poop of the ship. She was tired of having good manners and behaving like a 'good girl'. She wanted to be herself, but the world wouldn't let her. This is the reason why she thought of jumping from the ship into the ocean and put an end to her suffering. However, Jack - who was in the exact same place  - noticed what the girl was planning to do, and ran towards her in order to stop her from jumping. From that day onwards, Jack and Rose saw each other several times, until Rose's mother found out she was falling in love with Jack. <br/>  <br/> Rose's conversation with her mother brought her back to reality. She was about to get married, so she couldn't let her love story with Jack go any further. However, as Rose was sick of acting and pretending she was in love with Carl, she decided to go back with Jack. They kissed and made love, and promised that they would run away after the ship arrived in New York.  <br/>  <br/> However, neither the Titanic nor Jack made it to America: the ship sank after hitting an iceberg, and Jack didn't survive. However, Rose survived and was rescued. She arrived in New York several days later, and after that, she began a new life. She married another man and had children. However, her heart never stopped loving Jack.

He cleaned himself and then chose a cigarette to smoke.  <br/> After this, he was continuing his walk, when he suddenly saw an abandoned baby near the trash. He didn't know who the parents were so he started looking around until he found out a woman with a baby cart. He dediced to leave the baby there thinking, maybe, it was hers. However, when the woman found out, she started yelling at him. It seems that it wasn't hers. <br/> Because the man didn't know what to do with the baby, he went to the same place he found it to leave it there. Suddenly, a policeman appered so he couldn't do that. He left the place and saw an old man walking. He gave the baby to the old man and run off.  <br/> The old man dind't wanted the baby so he walked until he found a baby cart (the same as before) and leave the baby there when the mother wasn't looking. With all the bad luck, the man was walking in the street when the mother descovered the baby. She chased him and yelled at him. In this moment, the policeman appeared and started yealling at him too. <br/> In the end, he picked up the baby and took it with him. He sat down in the street and found a letter inside the baby's clothes that asked to please take care of that orphan baby. He then, realizing it didn't have a family smiled at the baby and took it home with him.

However, the name of the film has more to do with the main plot of the movie, since Idgie and Ruth, who are the protagonists, open a cafe whose main menu item is called like the title. As I've already mentioned, these two women are the focal point of the story, as they share a similar tragic background although they are completely different. While Ruth becomes a mother and gets married to an abusive man, Idgie refuses to settle and finds her own future without fitting standard gender roles. Although the storyline looks quite simple, the fact that it is narrated by an elderly lady called Ninny makes it more interesting as it creates a comparison between Idgie and Ruth's story and the current, more modern situation of Evelyn Couch, a mature wife who is really unhappy and tries to find her own self-confidence. Furthermore, the plot also involves the murder of Ruth's husband and the tragic death of Idgie's brother. In this sense. the film becomes the perfect field for a psicoanalitic study as well as a base for discussing gender roles, heteronormativity and even, racism. In general, I think this is a great movie since everytime you watch it, it gets better and you find out more about the underlying connections and metaphors that it entails.

The protagonist is a very powerful woman in America whose company has just gone bankrupt. Moreover, her boyfriend is not at all interested in the commitment of living together after 5 years of relationship. She decides to break up with him, but she has a mental breakdown and starts drinking. While being drunk, she enters an Inn contest for winning an Inn in New Zealand, which she wins. She decides to fly from America to New Zealand and fulfill her dream of building a sustainably maintained house. When she arrives she finds out that the Inn she's won, has actually been abandoned for decades. Nevertheless, she's committed to making it work. In this tiny town she meets a guy (obviously), who's actually really handsome and knows how to reform houses and even has a business for it. At first she hates him because she thinks he pitties her, but little by little she starts to understand that in this town, everyone helps each other not because of pity but because they care for each other and are nice like that. So eventually they fall in love, reform the house and travel together throughout New Zealand. The ex-boyfriend actually tries to win her back but it's too late. Finally, even though in the beginning her plan was to reform the Inn and go back to her life in San Francisco, she falls in love with her life in New Zealand and decides to stay in the house of her dreams with the man of her dreams.

Film	written_online	15	Outside classroom	Spellchecker	I have recently watched Marrowbone with some friends. The whole movie is about psychological issues but the audience doesn't know that until the very end. The protagonist is Jack, an eighteen-year-old guy. He, together with his mother and his siblings, moves to a house in the countryside. However, the mother dies soon and the four siblings stay in the house. From the very beginning the situation is weird, because Jack is obsessed with hiding all the mirrors and there is some secrecy regarding the father. Then, we discover that he was a murderer and went to prison, but he managed to escape. After the mother's death, the father showed up and apparently, the siblings locked him in the attic. But later on, the audience discovers this is not true. It was all product of Jack's imagination. The truth is that, when the father arrived, he killed his children in the attic. All of them except from Jack, who locked his father in the attic without food or drinks. However, the father did not die. After this, Jack went mad. He thought his brother and sister were still alive. He talked to them, he saw them, he played with them, etc. The characters of his siblings were actually ghosts produced by Jack's imagination. That is why he removed all the mirrors, because they demonstrated that his siblings were not real. One important thing is that the audience discovers the truth thanks to Jack's girlfriend, Allie. She gets his diary, reads it and finds out the truth. In that momento, she goes to the house looking for Jack but the father had escaped from the attic and tries to kill her. Jack recovers some common sense and finally kills his father to save her. At the end, Allie decides to stay with Jack.

He believes this child belongs to a woman who walks by him with another child but she is not the child's mother. Confused, Charles returns the baby to the spot where he found him but a policeman sees him so Charles decides to take the baby again. He tricks one man giving him the baby and runs away. Then, this man does the same and gives the baby to the woman that appeared before with another child and he runs away too. Suddenly, Charles appears in the same street where this woman is and she starts beating Charles until the policeman arrives again. Charles then decides to keep the baby and sits down when he finds a paper sticked to the baby's clothes saying to care and love the orphan child, which makes Charles keep the baby in the end.

While he was doing so, he saw a baby wrapped in blankets lying nearby. He picked up the baby and started looking around looking for his parents. He saw a woman walking by with a baby cart and thought that the baby was probably hers. As soon as he placed the baby in the cart, the woman started yelling at and hitting him because it wasn't hers. Then, Chaplin decided to leave again the baby where he had found it but a policeman saw it and Chaplin picked the baby up again. Afterwards, he made a man sustain it while he supposedly tie up his shoes and ran away. The man encountered the woman at the beginning of the story, placed the baby in the cart and ran away.  A bit later, the woman discovered the baby again in the cart and as she saw Chaplin walking nearby called the police and explained the situation. Chaplin picked up the baby again and after walking some time he sat down on the street thinking what he should do with the baby now. In that moment, he found a little note between the blankets that said that the baby was an orphan and asked whoever founded the baby to take care of him. After that, Chaplin smiled and decided to adopt him.

His cigarette is extinguished from one of these episodes, so he gets another cigarette from his pocket. He lights it and continues walking, but he suddenly hears a baby crying. The baby is lying on the ground, so Chaplin takes it. He looks for the person who might have left the baby there, but since he cannot see anybody else, he leaves the baby in a buggy. However, the woman who owns it sees Chaplin leaving the baby there and starts yelling at him. Chaplin takes the baby from the buggy and starts wondering again. He was going to put the baby back where he found it when a police officer came by and ordered him to keep the baby. Chaplin started walking with the baby when he saw an old man, to whom he tricked to get rid of the baby. Chaplin ran off to hide somewhere. In the meanwhile, the old man left the baby in the buggy where Chaplin had first left the baby. The woman did not see this old man leaving the baby in her buggy, so, later, when she saw Chaplin again, she blamed him. The police officer was around, and she told him about what she thought Chaplin had done. The police officer told him off and obliged him to take the baby with him. Chaplin, hopeless, sat down on the street. He was staring at the baby when he found a note wrapped in the baby's clothes, which said that the baby was an orphan, and asked the person reading it to love and take care or it. Chaplin smiled, stood up and left the scene with the baby.

It is also a critique on alternative medicine as the antagonist in the movie is a journalist who claims to have found the solution to this epidemic and anticipates that the vaccine will not be effective.

Even though I am not a big fan of horror movies, given that they are bad by nature, I had a grand time watching this film. It all started when I was going home after finishing my university lectures when some friends suggested that we could meet at somebody's house and have a movie night. After quite a long time deciding what to watch, we compromised and gave ""Annabelle"" a shot. The actual plot of the movie is nothing new: a happy family is tormented by a evil spirit. However, it is worth mentioning that the way it was executed was nothing less than brilliant. Instead of relying on jump-scares, the movie slowly builds up the tension from the very start. In fact, some friends were even closing their eyes at some points of the movie. Nonetheless, on a personal note, I must say that the movie should have been classified as a thriller more than a horror film since I did not find it really scary at all. I guess that even when movies are not that original or scary, the most important part of is the experience of watching it with a group of friends."

This film is starred by Joaquin Phoenix, and it is one of the biggest blockbusters of this year. It provides a possible origin for the character appearing in Batman's saga. But this film goes way beyond focusing on Batman's movies, since it follows the life of Arthur Fleck, a man who suffers mental illness and tries to do stand-up comedy but fails in his attempt. I believe that this film is so important because it treats the issue of mental illness, and it gives visibility to this issue. During the film, the character complains about the fact that society tends to expect people suffering mental illnesses to behave as if they do not have it, and I agree with this quote.  <br/> Besides, when I saw this film, it reminded me of another film called 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', which also deals with mental disorders.

He opens a silver cage where he stores a couple of cigars. Then, he grabs one and he lights it. He suddenly hears a cry and realizes that there is a baby on the floor. As he approaches the baby, a mum appears pushing a baby carriage. He grabs the baby and runs towards her to leave the infant inside it.

In this moment, a police officer appears and a scared Chaplin takes the baby again and leaves the scene. In another street, Chaplin finds the opportunity of getting rid of the baby and, discreetly, he gives the baby to a man and runs away.

He starts smoking and some bricks are thrown at him. Therefore, the cigar he was smoking is useless now, so he takes a new one out of a box he's carrying. Just after he gets rid of his gloves, he notices an abandoned child laying on the pavement. He grabs the baby and spots a woman carrying a baby cart, which he follows right after. He places the baby inside, but after being told off by the woman, he takes the baby and walks away. He gives the baby to a passer-by, who is shocked. Then, he puts the baby in the trolley of the woman from before. The main character walks happily now, but the woman runs into him and starts hitting him because she thinks he has placed the baby in there.  In the middle of the argument, a police officer shows up wondering what the fight is all about. In order to avoid trouble, the man from the beginning keeps the baby. He seems not to know what to do next because he clearly does not want to keep it. He then realises there is a note inside the baby's clothing, remarking that it is a orphan child who needs to be looked after. His feelings change and now he happily walks away with the baby.

The main character of the scene finds an abandoned baby in what appears to be a dilapidated building. While questioning how the baby got there, the character finds a woman who is pushing a baby carriage. The man accuses the woman of abandoning the child –since he uses the verb “drop”– but the woman denies the accusation and refuses to take care of the baby. The main protagonist tries to find an alternative way to get rid of the baby, and tricks an unknown man. After a series of events (that unknown man leaves the baby in the woman’s baby carriage, the woman accuses Chaplin of trying to abandon the child, and a police office is closely keeping an eye on him), the character gives up and sits on the kerb. At the end of the scene, he realises there is a letter inside the child’s clothes, in which it is stated that the baby is an orphan. After reading the letter, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby.

He takes the baby again and leaves. After turning round the corner, he gives the baby to a man on the street, pretending that he is just going to tie his shoelaces.

At first, he thinks someone might have dropped him by accident so he tries to return it to a woman passing by with her own baby, but she yells at him, probably because she believes he is trying to get rid of his baby. When Chaplin runs away from the angry mother, he puts the baby back when he found him; nevertheless, a policeman unexpectedly appears and he has to take the baby with him. However, he still tries to get rid of the poor creature by giving it to an old man and running away. The old man tries to chase him, but when he is unable to do so, he just tries to give the baby to someone else as well. He encounters the same mother Chaplin had already tried to give the baby to and runs away. When Chaplin passes by the woman and she realises the baby is there, she beats him up and screams at him violently. When the same policeman approaches to see what is happening, Chaplin just takes the baby again and goes away to avoid conflict. He seems to wonder what is he going to do with him when he realises there is a note between the clothes that wrap the child. In the note, the father or mother of the baby asks for whoever that encounters him, to please love and take care of him. Then, Chaplin decides to take the baby with him.

When he gets to an alley and lits a cigarette, he finds a child, very little and wrapped in a scarf, in the dirt pavement. Apparently by chance, a woman passes by with a baby trolley and the man, thinking the woman dropped the child unintentionally, places the baby in the carrier. The woman gets really mad that he has tried to place an unknown child with hers and forces him to take it back. After many unsuccessful attempts at getting rid of the baby, the man finds a handwritten letter pleading with whoever found it to care for the child. The man ultimately heeds this, and we are led to believe he does so.

In these films, the protagonist, which is kind of a magical creature, always has to fight against the humans that want to destroy her lands. The problem is that in this second part, her goddaughter is a human and wants to get married with the prince of the reign. Before the celebration, both Maleficent and her goddaughter are invited to the castle to have dinner. Once they are there the protagonist gets really furious remembering all the attacks she and her creatures have received in the past. In addition to this, the queen is constantly attacking her. Because of this, Maleficent leaves the castle, forbidding her goddaughter to get married. Then she leaves the city and find other creatures like her that help her in saving the lands and uniting both humans and creatures.

After some discussion we finally decided to watch Annabelle despite the fact that I am not keen on horror movies since I easily get scared and they always try to take advantage of that.  <br/> Regarding the plot, the only thing worth mentioning is that I wouldn't consider a creepy doll a good present, neither would I marry someone who is obsessed with collecting them. Moreover, this type of storyline is excessively overused and somewhat boring at this point. They have really dull, plane characters that do not ease the watching of the film for the spectator who is just hoping the doll would do anything other than stand there and exist. <br/> Irony aside, I consider this production to be just another addition to the genre, not bringing a lot to the table in regards of the content and performance of the action. For the purpose of pure entertainment it could be good enough, but it is definitely not worth paying the money.

It’s about a guy who discovers he can time travel, and he uses his powers to conquer the love of his life. Sometimes he’s a little bit silly and doesn’t foresee the consequences to some of his travels, but overall it gets the viewer really involved with him and his life. I would also like to mention that this movie is not only about love, but is also about family, friendship and living your life the best way possible.

At first, he looks at the near buildings trying to find someone who could have forgot the child without success. Then, he picks him up and, thinking he might be the child of a lady that walks by at that precise moment, he tries to get the baby back to her. He puts the baby in the stroller, next to the other baby of the said lady, and she gets angry. She hits the man and apparently tells him the baby is not hers, so the man takes the baby back and tries to put him in the same spot where he founded him. This time, a policeman arrives and, thinking he may be abandoning that baby, gives the man a suspicious look. The man, alarmed, urgently picks up the baby again and takes him with him. <br/> Walking down the street, he tries to trick some other old man to pick up the baby and, without hesitating, he runs away. The old man, trying to find the man who tricked him, findsthe same lady that hit the man previously and leaves the baby in the stroller one more time and runs away. <br/> At the same time, the man who found the baby in the first place and then tricked someone to avoid keeping the baby, manages to run away safely. The only problem is that he meets the policeman again. To avoid suspicious situations one more time, he changes his path with so bad luck that he finds the lady that now is with an ""extra"" child. The lady bursts with anger and starts to hit the man so hard that he even ends up in the ground. The policeman arrives and the man has no choice rather than to pick the baby again. <br/> Devastated, he sits in the sidewalk with no more company than the baby. When he watches closely, he finds that the baby has a note in his clothes asking the one who finds the baby to give him love and care, for he is an orphan. The man, now motivated by the note, changes his face expression indicating that he may want to keep the child and perhaps raise him, and that he would give him the love and care the note asked for."

As they start it up, one by one are sucked inside the game, appearing in the middle of the jungle with the physical appearance and abilities of the avatar they had previously chosen. Their adventure then begins, challenging not only their integrity but their trust in each other, and even in themselves. They will have to flee from some situations, such as escaping from the hands of a gold-digger who'll do anything to recover a gem the group is to return to its original place in order to end with the curse that has sank the jungle in an obscure mood. Eventually, with the help of a fifth player, who has been years trapped in the game, they'll accomplish their mission, and go back home, as if not a single minute has gone away. The four of them, now with a bond that breaks through classes, discover that the older kid they found in the game, is now an adult with a family of its own.

Film	written_online	15	Outside classroom	Spellchecker	Last week I watched a film called “Everything is illuminated”. I actually really liked this movie and I found it really inspiring because it was so creative that it made me want to create my own stories. The main character was a young American jew called Jonathan whose grandparents came to America from Ukraine because of World War II. The young man goes to Ukraine to try to find the woman who helped his now deceased grandfather escape from the nazis. There he meets an old man and his grandson called Alex who are the owners and only employees of a company that helps people find their ancestors. Alex becomes the other main character because of his big personality and the continuous cultural shocks between him and Jonathan give the movie a humorous touch. The big reveal is that the Ukrainian old man, Alex’s grandfather, is in fact also a jew and he was connected with the woman that helped Jonathan’s grandfather escape the nazis because her sister helped him as well. The movie ends with the old man’s suicide and his family giving him a jewish funeral in homage of all those years of hiding.  <br/> I think this is now one of my favourite films because it talks about something political and let’s you know about horrible things that actually happened but the director also knew how to give the story a humorous touch with surrealist moments and the help of the previously commented cultural shocks. I think this film is worth watching.

After shooting and killing some important bussinesmen on the underground, he becomes a public figure seen as a revolutionary working-class hero and that's how his hunger for a rather violent  'social justice' begins.

He tried to give it to different strangers, but no one wanted to keep it. He first tried to give it to a mother with a stroller, but the woman was upset and forced him to take back the child. Next, he tried to trick a man in the street by tieing his shoes and having him hold the baby. Chaplin ran away and the stranger saw the woman with the stroller and dropped off the baby there. The woman saw the baby then saw Chaplin walking around and chased him and gave the baby back. Chaplin was conflicted because he did not know how to properly dispose of the child. Towards the end, he read a letter notifying him that the baby was an orphan and decided to keep it.

While he passes another street, trash falls on him from a window. Then, he stops and takes out his cigarette packet. He chooses on and after putting it in his mouth, he takes off his gloves little by little and lights the cigarette with a match, which he lights on the sole of his show and throws it in the bin. Suddenly, he sees a baby on the floor next to the trash. Chaplin look up to see if someone has thrown the baby out the window and pick him up. He sees a woman with a baby stroller and follows her.

Chaplin	written_online	70	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English), Monolingual dictionary	"Charles is smoking while walking down an alley in what seems to be a lower-class neighbourhood. Everything is covered in dust and dirt and people are throwing their trash out of the window, and as it is to be expected, Charles gets bathed with one of these garbage rains. He looks up at the person in the window and screams some obscenities before taking a small box out of his blazer to get another cigarette since the one he was previously smoking fell off his mouth with the impact. Putting the box back in its original place and ungloving his hands, Charles takes a match out of his waistcoat pocket and lights it using the sole of his shoe and proceeds to start his cigarette, getting rid of his gloves and throwing them into a trash can near him right after. He's just dusted his hands and taken the first puff when he hears a noise. Looking down to his left he sees a baby wrapped in some thin sheets and blankets lying on the ground. Charles bents down and checks under covers to make sure it is in a baby and then looks around confusedly, trying to find someone, probably someone who could be this kid's parent. Seeing, there's no one, he picks it up, and that's when a woman with a stroller passes by. Charles calls her up but the woman doesn't hear him, so he walks after her. However, when he catches up and gets to the stroller, the woman is nowhere to be seen, so he does what he considers logical and puts the baby in it, next to the woman's kid. The woman reappears seconds after and Charles tells her ""she's dropped something"" and attempts to leave, but the woman won't let him. Gesticulating and making her anger very visible, she gets Charles to take the baby back into his arms, but not before he mistakenly tries to pick up the wrong kid, which only makes the woman more agitated. After the encounter both people go their separate ways, Charles going back to the corner where he found the baby with the intention of leaving him there, never realising he's being watched by a police officer that's standing right behind him. The baby barely gets the chance to touch the ground because, as soon as Charles turns around and sees the expression of the imposing officer, he quickly changes his mind and picks the baby back up, walking away from the officer immediately. Once he's far enough, Charles tries his luck again. Seeing an old man, he stops him and gets him to hold the baby with the excuse of needing to tied his shoes. Charles kneels down just long enough for the old man to believe the lie before he sets off running to go and hide. The old man goes in his search, but not being able to find him, decides to do what Charles had done earlier and puts the baby in the woman's stroller that is now next to a shoe store and runs away. The woman shows up a moment later and is looking at the two babies incredulously when she sees Charles, who's has left his hiding place, walk past her without a care. She runs after him and attacks him from behind with her big umbrella, tackling him down to the ground where she keeps hitting him. This diverts into a heated discussion that only finishes when the police officer reappears and both the woman and Charles leave with their respective babies. Charles then sits on the pavement, with the baby still in his arms, contemplating what to do next. A manhole cover next to him catches then his attention.  He lifts it up, briefly considering whether he could do what he's thinking of doing, but then disregards the idea within a second. It's then, looking at the baby, that he realises there's a note stuck to its clothes, a note which reads ""Please, love and care for this orphan kid"". Charles doesn't have the heart to get rid of the kid after that. He looks down at the kid and smiles. Taking the walking stick he had laid next to him on the pavement, he gets up and leaves, holding the baby protectively against his chest."

In this retelling of the classic Disney movie, we encounter the character of Maleficent again but from her side of the story. The king cuts her wings at the beginning of the story in order to become king and even though he and Maleficent are supposedly in love. Maleficent tries to take revenge by cursing the king's daughter and for the next 16 years the king becomes paranoid of a possible attack from Maleficent. Maleficent gets to know Aurora (the princess) in these 16 years and a bond is formed between both women. After the cursed takes effect it is Maleficent's kiss, one of true love, what in the end awakes Aurora from the curse. In the end, Maleficent recovers her wings and the king dies as an indirect effect of his own paranoia and bitterness.

In the moment he takes the baby from the floor he sees a lady with a buggy behind him, so he thinks that the lady might have lost the baby. He walks towards the buggy and place the baby inside while the woman is inside the building. When the woman leaves the building she reacts like that baby is not her kid and she asks (or probably imposes) Chaplin to pick the kid and leave, at first Chaplin attempts to take the other baby but she indicates that the baby he was trying to take wasnt the one he had put in the buggy before, then he picks up the right baby. Chaplin walks away with the baby and tries to leave the baby where he found it, next to the rubbish, but a police officer appears and Chaplin takes the baby back. In the next scene, Chaplin asks another gentleman to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes, when Chaplin has the chance he runs away and hide. The gentleman tries to follow him but he can't find Chaplin, however he finds the lady's buggy and place the baby in it, one more time. When the woman sees the baby again she starts looking across the street and when she sees Chaplin she hits him with her umbrella, they start arguing because none of them want to take the baby, the police officer appears again and Chaplin, scared of the officer, take the baby and goes away.

However, after being aware of all the positive criticism and how inspiring it was for some of my colleagues and close friends, I decided (and I don't regret) to watch it. Indeed it makes you see the theme of love in a different way from what we are used to. Thought-provoking plot and stunning interpretation by its lead actor, a teenager who falls in homosexual love with an intern student that his father has brought home for the summer holidays. Uncertainty, passion and how natural love in any of its occurrences is are the engine of the film."

While he is walking and smoking, somebody is throwing debris to the street from a window.  <br/> He keeps walking. Then, near some rubbish bins, some rubbish falls on him from above. He looks up to see who did that and retrieves a metal box from his jacket pocket. Inside, cigars and cigarettes can be found. He takes a cigarette and removes his gloves; after that, he lights a match in his right sole to light his cigarette. Then, he throws his gloves away and looks to his left. There, next to the rubbish bins, a baby, wrapped in blankets, lies on the floor.  <br/> He touches the baby carefully and looks around as if trying to find whose baby this is. Since he finds nobody, he holds the baby. While he is trying to find its parents, a woman pulling a baby stroller appears in the background. He calls her and runs towards her. And, immediately after reaching her, he places the baby in the stroller, where there is already another baby. The woman, surprised, starts yelling at him and tells him to hold the baby again, as it is assumed it is not hers. He obeys, but almost takes the wrong baby. Finally, he retrieves the right baby from the stroller and runs away from the woman.  <br/> He goes back to the corner where he found the baby and puts it in the same place. A police officer appears. He blows a kiss to the baby but after seeing the police officer he takes the baby again.  <br/> He starts walking and sees another man, with a cane, on his way. He asks him to hold the baby while he cleans his shoes as he stepped into a muddy puddle. Once the stranger is holding the baby, Chaplin runs away. The stranger follows him as fast as he can, but Chaplin finds a place with a door open and hides there. In his search, the stranger finds the abovementioned stroller and, since nobody is watching it, he puts the baby inside and runs. When Chaplin leaves his secret place he finds the police officer on his way so he starts walking fast in the opposite direction. Then, the previous woman returns to her stroller and finds two babies instead of one. So, when Chaplin passes by them, she calls him in the middle of the street. However, he pretends not to have heard anything and keeps walking. So she starts running after him and hits his head with her umbrella until he is lying on the floor. She grabs him and takes him with her until they both reach the stroller. Then, she warns him to take the baby. In fact, as the police officers passes by, she calls him to inform about their situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and everybody resumes their way.  <br/> After a few steps, Chaplin drops his cane by a sewer. So he sits down to retrieve it and lifts the top of the sewer thinking about putting the baby there. Nevertheless, he thinks twice and rejects this idea. While he is figuring out how to hold the baby and his cane at the same time, he finds a letter between the baby's blankets indicating to love and care for that orphan child. After reading it, Chaplin feels sorry for the baby, keeps the letter in his inner pocket and smiles at the baby. He stands up and eventually takes the baby with him.

His dog used to wander around the house freely but the frog spent the whole day inside a glass bottle covered with a lid that could only be opened by a person. One night, the lid was not tight enough and the frog escaped while the boy was sleeping. When he got up, he found out that his frog was not where it used to be and started to wonder what could have happened. His dog tried to encourage him and even forced him to go out to look for the frog. They both went to the country and searched every single place there, from a cave to the top of a tree. By chance, they were pushed towards a river and fell down into the water. Luckily, they discovered the little frog with its family.

Next to where he is standing, he finds a baby and assumes he/she is the child of a lady who's walking in the alley as well, pushing a baby stroller with another baby in it. The main character approaches her and gives her the baby, but the child is not hers so the protagonist leaves the baby where he found it. Just as he is doing that, a police officer shows up and gives him a judgemental look, making the protagonist take the baby again. He then finds an old man and gives the baby to him before running away. This old man leaves the baby in the stroller of the lady when she is not looking and runs away. While he does that, Chaplin's character encounters the police officer again and runs away from him. He is caught by the woman, who assumes he was the one to put the baby in the stroller and she follows him to beat him. The same police officer appears again and the woman explains the situation to him, which leaves no choice for the protagonist other than to take the baby. He is desperate and even considers putting the baby in a sewer, but finds a note attached to him/her that says: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". This ultimately convinces him to 'adopt' the baby."

Someone, probably some workers, is throwing rubble from the window of a building, which almost hits the man. He keeps walking, until another worker throws more rubble through another window; this time, the protagonist gets hit. He gets angry and insults the worker; he also realises he has lost his cigarette, so he picks another one from a metal case and lights it. He intends to keep walking, when he notices a little baby lying on the floor, wrapped up in a blanket and crying. The man looks around to see if the baby has fallen from a window, and he picks him up. Suddenly, he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy, with another kid in it. The man comes closer and leaves the baby inside the buggy, but the woman yells at him and tells him to take the baby out of the buggy.  <br/>  <br/> The man picks the baby and he intends to leave the kid where he was lying, but a policeman shows up, so the man has to pick him up again. He walks with the baby in his arms until he sees an old man walking down the street. He asks him to hold the baby with the excuse of tying up his shoelaces, but once he leaves the baby in the old man's arms, he runs away. The old man doesn't know what to do, but he sees a baby buggy on the street, so he leaves the baby in it. The same woman that appeared before comes out of a shop, and she gets very angry when she sees the baby in the buggy again. Suddenly, the protagonist of the video shows up, so she thinks he has left the baby there and runs after him to beat him with her umbrella. She forces him to take the baby, and when the policeman shows up again, she asks him for help, so the protagonist has to pick the baby up. <br/>  <br/> The man walks away from the street with the baby in his arms, until he sits on the pavement. He doesn't know what to do. He sees a drain next to the pavement; he opens it and looks at the baby, but he nods and closes the drain. He looks at the baby again, and he feels something in the blanket. He takes out a piece of paper, where he reads: ""please love and care of this orphan child"". The protagonist feels moved by the letter; now his feelings towards the baby have changed. He stands up and walks away, taking the baby with him."

As he walks past the buildings, some of the people inside throw rubbish out the windows, hitting the tramp. When he reaches the foreground, and after cursing the last person who's thrown his or her rubbish on him, he searches for his cigarette box in his jacket pockets. There are only butts in his box, but he lights one and smokes. He removes his mittens in the process to do it more easily, but then decides to just throw them away instead of putting them back on or in his pocket. <br/>  <br/> At that precise moment he hears a baby crying next to him, and finds him on the ground, wrapped in some blankets, by a rubbish can. The tramp looks up, thinking that maybe someone has thrown the baby away through the window with the trash. He lifts the infant. Behind him a lady passes with a pushchair. The tramp sees her and walks up to her to give her the child--""Excuse me, you've dropped something""--says the tramp to her. If he is either innocently trying to return the baby to his mother, or cunningly trying to get rid of the child, we are not told; his attitude is ambiguous. The tramp then tries to leave the baby in the pushchair. The lady, outraged by what she perceives as the tramp's knavery,  rebukes him severely and forces him to take the baby back with him. <br/>  <br/> When Charlot is about to leave the child back where he found him, a policeman catches him red-handed, so he sees himself in the obligation to take the baby with him again. After that, he comes across a bearded hobo, and pretends he has to do his shoelace to ask him to hold the baby for a second, taking advantage of this to escape without the baby. He runs off and hides; the bearded vagabond looks for him, but, unable to find Charlot, he tries to leave the baby in a pushchair he sees at the door of a shoe-shop. He walks off. Charlot gets out of his hideout, but stumbles upon the police officer, which makes him turn around and take the opposite direction. The lady he encountered before steps out of the shop where the pushchair was, and just at that moment he passes by. This coincidence makes the lady think it is him again who has tried to sneak another baby in her pushchair. This time the furious lady beats the tramp violently with her umbrella. The policeman arrives while they are quarreling, and in consequence the tramp has no choice but to take the baby again with him. <br/>  <br/> As he wanders along the sidewalk with the child in his arms, the tramp drops his cane stick. He sits on the curb, picks up his stick and suddenly notices the gutter. He considers for a dramatic moment to throw the baby down the gutter, but discards the brutish option. He begins examining the child, who bits his finger. Thus, he finds a piece of paper among the baby's clothes, with a message written on it: ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". This message at last convinces him to take responsability. He smiles at the baby, gets up and walks off with him."

It tells the story of an Argentinian middle-aged men who leads a very isolated life working in an appliance store. He basically rejects human contact due to trauma. If I remember correctly, his mother died when he was very young. In his teens he had a huge quarrel with his father and, right after that, he decides to enlist himself in the army to participate as a soldier in the War of Las Malvinas. His father was so disappointed in him, since he himself had feed from Italy to escape from war. While the protagonist is abroad, his father dies, so he never had a chance to reconcile with his father. After many years spent in isolation, a Chinese immigrant appears on the scene. He's lost and vulnerable, so the protagonist is forced to get out of his shell to help this man. It's a very sweet comedy. I do recommend it.

In the first scene of the video, Chaplin is in the middle of an alley, where people are throwing away what seems to be rubble and dirt until one person throws rubbish upon him. In a close-up image of Chaplin, we can see he is wearing mittens and grab a cigarette just before seeing a baby abandoned in the middle of the alley. As he does not know what to do with this child, he tries to get rid of him in different ways. First, he tries to get the baby in a lady’s baby pushchair, with another baby in it. He is caught, so he tries to leave the baby in the same place he found it, being caught again by a police officer. In his third attempt, he manages to do get rid of the baby, leaving him with a bearded man. However, eventually, the baby ends up again in the lady’s pushchair and as she recognises Chaplin, she told him off and calls the same police officer that was patrolling there. Finally, Chaplin, just when he is about to leave the kid in the sewage system, finds a note, in which someone wrote that this kid is an orphan and requests that whoever has found him to take care of him. This final letter seems to be the conclusive reason for Chaplin to adopt the child.

He stops, brushes off the dust and takes out a cigarrette tin. The tramp takes off his  worn off gloves, of which most fingers are missing, and carefully selects a cigarrette stub from an assortment of cigarrette and cigar ends, lights it striking a match on his sole. He throws away the match into a bin and then throws the gloves too. After walkin on a few steps, he finds a little  baby lying on the floor, picks it up and looks up as if the baby could have fallen off a window. The tramp turns around and sees a woman pushing a big perambulator carrying one baby, he imagines she dropped the baby he found and puts it inside the perambulator but the woman complains, so he takes the baby again and puts it carefully where he found it but as he's about to leave the baby a policeman arrives so The tramp turns immediately, picks up the baby again and goes away. <br/> While The tramp is carrying the baby, he walks by a passer-by, pretends to have to tie his shoelace and ask the unknown to hold the baby but as soon as the passer-by has the baby in his hands, the tramp runs away. The unknown sees a perambulator outside a shop, puts the baby inside and leaves. As The tramp is walking by, the mother and owner of the perambulator comes out of the shop, discovers the second baby and guesses the Tramp has done it again. She chases him and hits him with her umbrella back to the perambulator. When they are discussing about the baby the same cop arrives again and The tramp takes the baby and leaves. He sits on the curb and considers throwing the baby into the sewer but on second thoughts he doesn't and pets it. Something pricks his finger and he finds a note saying please love and care this orphan child. He decides to do it.

Famous person	written_online	15	Outside classroom	""	He is probably one of the most relevant presidents of the United States. Nobody could imagine that an African American would be elected president. Barack Obama came to break down the walls that divided the American society. His policies aimed to create a fairer country for everyone. For example, he tried to set up a national healthcare system so that poor people did not need a private insurance to be able to go to hospitals. He also promised that he would shut down Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but he could not keep his promise due to an unfavourable situation in the American Senate and House of Representatives. His cool and fresh style has been unique, but nowadays politicians such as Justin Trudeau are trying to approach the citizens with the same strategies that Obama followed.  <br/> Donald Trump's style is different from Obama's style. We still do not know whether Trump is going to be as esteemed as Obama or not, but it is obvious that they are completely different characters.

However, the old man puts the baby again in the pram of the woman, making her mad. Chaplin has no option but to take the kid and leave. He finally ends pitying the baby and taking care of him.

Chaplin	written_online	30	Outside classroom	Bilingual dictionary (Spanish/English)	From afar comes a man, actually, he is Charles Chaplin, he wears a scruffy suit, a hat and big shoes. This bizarre outfit gives him a funny air. He has a cigarette between his lips and when he blows the smoke comes as if he was a steam locomotive. He walks like nothing around him matters, like he is oblivious of his surrounding. He passes below an open window, from which a man appears and throw something white, perhaps dust or flour, who knows. Mr. Chaplin looks at the fallen thing just for a second and continues with his walk in that clumsy way he has. He approaches and gets closer and closer. And while he walks, he changes the cane he is holding from one hand to another and plays with it and bends it. Suddenly, something from above falls on his head and this time it really bothers him. He looks up and down trying to find from where that thing comes. Then, from his pocket he gets a tin, a tobacco tin, he opens it and take one cigarette. Then, he takes the tin back to his pocket and after removing his gloves he lights the cigarette and starts smoking again. He gets rid of the gloves by throwing them into a bin and when he looks at his right he finds a baby crying wrapped up in a blanket. He looks everywhere trying to find his parents. “Where this baby comes from?”, he seems to wonder. He takes the baby in his arms and in the distance he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy. Thinking that perhaps she is the baby’s mother, Mr. Chaplin puts the baby inside the buggy. When the women finds out, she starts yelling at him and he can do nothing but to take the baby away and retrieve the poor thing to his or her original place. However, a policeman just appears from nowhere and looks at him in an earnest way that makes Mr. Chaplin take the baby again in a rush and leave. Afterwards, he finds an old man walking in a cane; he gives the baby to him and flees. The old man goes after him but Mr. Chaplin hides away. In his way, trying to find Mr. Chaplin, the old man just by chance finds the baby baggy mentioned above and leaves the baby inside it and runs away. When the woman finds out that there was an “intruder”, she gets really crossed. The funny thing is that Mr. Chaplin walks in front of her own eyes, so the women goes after him shouting and raising her umbrella and pointing it at him. She starts striking him repeatedly, shouting at him and demanding an explanation. The policeman appears and approaches since these two are enrolled in an argument, the woman explains what has just happened and Mr. Chaplin just takes the baby away once again. He seats down and next to him finds a gutter and opens it. For just a moment, he weights his possibilities. However, something happens: the baby carries a note which reads “Please, love and care for this orphan child”. Mr. Chaplin looks at the baby with compassion and kindness, takes him in his arms and without raising his eyes from him, leaves the scene.

Chaplin	written_online	3	Outside classroom	""	At first, we see Chaplin walking through the city until he stops to smoke a cigarette. He, then, founds a baby wrapped in a blanket but because he is unable to find the baby's parents, he tries putting it back where he found it. At the same time, a policeman appears and obviously thinks it is Chaplin who is abandoning the baby so he is forced to take it with him. He tricks a random man into holding the baby and then takes off. However, after turning a corner, he founds himself accused of abandoning the baby by a woman and ends up with the baby in his arms again. After all, it seems like Chaplin is destined to care for the baby and takes it with him.
