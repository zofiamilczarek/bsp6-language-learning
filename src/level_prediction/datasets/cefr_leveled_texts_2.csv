"It is not made of silicon; and it is not a river valley; but forgetting that, Silicon Valley is probably the most famous valley in the world. Although it is not the place where the first computer was built (that was Manchester, England), Silicon Valley, near San Francisco,  was the birthplace of the modern computer industry.
    For this, we can say thank you to scientists at the universities in California, and to the Hippies of the 1960's.
    It was in the nineteen-sixties that American ""youth culture"" really began. California, of course, already existed; but the Sixties Generation rediscovered it. 
    At the time there were really two different forms of youth culture; the ""Beach Boy"" culture on the one hand, and the anti-establishment hippies and radical students on the other hand; and they all dreamed of California.
    For the Beach Boys, that meant southern California, where they could sing about surfing and cars; for the Hippies and radicals, it meant San Francisco, ""flower power"" and revolutionary new ideas. The campuses at Berkeley and Stanford, near San Francisco, were hot-beds of new ideas, new technology, new culture, and new ways of living.  
   When they finished university, many of the best students did not look for jobs with big companies like Ford or Exxon. Instead they wanted to be free and run their own operations... and stay in California, not far from San Francisco. Silicon Valley is thus a group of small towns, including Palo Alto and San José,  a few miles south of San Francisco.

"Besides these big sports, America of course has basketball - perhaps the most successful ""export"". Invented at Springfield College, Massachusetts, in 1891, Basketball is quite certainly an ""American game"". Although it is not as big in Europe as in the USA, basketball has become much more popular in other countries than any other American team sport.
Why is America different? The answer is simple. Until the 1960's, team sports were not played on a global scale. In Europe, people played European games, and in North America we played American games. The only real ""global"" sports were individual sports, such as golf and tennis.
A hundred years ago, individual rich Americans could travel to Europe on holiday, and play these two games. But whole teams of sportsmen did not often travel around the world, it was too difficult and slow!

The first worldwide sports competition was the Olympic Games; but originally the Olympics were only concerned with athletics; they did not include the wide variety of sports that they now cover.
So as far as team sports are concerned, America has grown up with its own tradition; we love our ""football"" and our baseball and our basketball. We don't mind if these sports are not popular in other countries. That way, we can organise the ""World Series"" baseball championship, knowing that a US team will almost always win. From time to time, a Canadian team wins.... but they're North Americans too, after all.

"After Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry, gave birth to her first and only child, she and her husband, King Oeagus, held a celebration in honour of their newborn son. Calliope wore a violet-coloured wreath on her head and a long white robe. The only sign that her son, Orpheus, was with her was a small bundle of blue-white silk held carefully in her arms.
They were in an open area among the mountains of Thrace where everyone could sing and dance, but Calliope's high-backed stone chair was kept in the shade of the trees to protect the child from the midday sun. King Oeagus stood next to his wife while relatives and friends came and laid gifts at their feet, wishing them and their child everlasting happiness.
The other eight Muses came, each bringing a gift from the art or science they had influence over. When they had left their gifts with the others, they all sat beside Calliope and Oeagus to wait for Apollo, the god of music and light. He, of all the gods, could tell men their futures. Yet he spoke through the Muses, and they were like children to him. His arrival would be the highlight of the celebration.
A light music came through the movement of the trees leaves. It was so light that it could hardly be heard, yet everyone heard it and stopped what they were doing. A wind began to blow and with it, the music was carried closer to people's ears. It passed through their ears and filled their bodies, making them feel that the earth below their feet and everything about them was moving to the same beautiful rhythm.

"Madame Thibault's Hall of Waxworks attracted a lot of visitors. The front of the building was bright with red and yellow lights, even during the day. Inside the hall were scenes of murders, and other famous historical events, with lifelike figures made out of wax.
Clive Wilkes loved the place, both the outside and the inside. He was a delivery boy for a small supermarket, so he was often able to find some free time during the day to stop and visit the Waxworks. At the entrance to the hall there was a man sitting at a desk selling tickets. Then, after passing through a dark area, you came to the main hall. There in front of you was a bloody murder scene: a girl with long fair hair was pushing a knife into the neck of an old man, who sat at a table eating his dinner. His dinner was a plate of wax meat and wax potatoes.
Next there was the eighteenth-century Frenchman, Marat, who was killed as he sat in his bath; then the murder of President Kennedy, and then a scene in a Nazi prison camp. Clive loved every scene, and he never got tired of looking at them. But they didn't frighten him as they frightened other people - they made him smile, or even laugh. They were funny. Why not laugh?
One thing which Clive wanted to do very much was to spend a night in the Hall. It wouldn't be too difficult. Clive knew that three people worked there, as well as the ticket seller at the door.

"Jane Addams: A Woman of Character
When you think of women in history who have been true pioneers, the name Jane Addams should come to mind.  In the late 1800s, she founded Hull House, an institution called a settlement house, in Chicago, Illinois.  Hull House was established as a resource for immigrants as well as for any other residents of Chicago in need of assistance.  Its mission reflected the compassionate spirit of its founder, who had visited a similar institution, called Toynbee Hall, while visiting London, England. Throughout her life, Jane Addams worked very hard.  She was a skillful fundraiser, and when an economic downturn occurred, it was up to her to acquire the funds necessary to keep Hull House running.  She accomplished this by writing and lecturing across the country.  She continually used the money she earned through her hard work to improve the lives of others. Fundraising, however, was certainly not her most noteworthy accomplishment. Among her many other accomplishments, Addams was a leader in the movement to secure voting rights for women.  In 1931 she was honored with one of the most important awards in the world, the Nobel Peace Prize.  This recognition was especially significant because Jane Addams was the first American woman ever to receive this prize.  Jane Addams’s devotion and selflessness are qualities that will live on through others who are inspired by her sense of dedication and courage.",B1
"On her 21st birthday Elizabeth went on an official tour of South Africa, delivering a speech dedicating herself to the service of the Commonwealth.
Elizabeth's father King George VI was suffering from poor health. Elizabeth continued to take on royal duties, and over the next few years she played a greater public role as her father's health declined. She had her own private secretary and was given access to Foreign Office telegrams, which arrived in boxes dedicated to her and read daily parliamentary reports.
Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten were married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947. She wore a dress she'd paid for with ration tokens.
Although Elizabeth and Philip were in love, the young princess’s husband was a controversial choice. He was foreign born, with no financial standing and no kingdom. He had sisters married to Nazis, who were not invited to the wedding. Philip gave up his Greek and Danish titles and changed his religion to marry Elizabeth. Now married for over 65 years, the Queen has had the longest marriage of any UK monarch.
Elizabeth's first child, Charles, was born in 1948. Anne followed two years later.
Elizabeth had been tutored privately when she was young but she and Philip decided their children should attend boarding school as Philip had done. Like her parents before her, Princess Elizabeth left her children for several months to fulfil royal duties. The royal couple also lived together for periods without their children at Philip’s naval base in Malta. As a young royal, Elizabeth's life was one in which family life had to be balanced against public duties.",B1
"Antarctica is the world’s southernmost continent. The word ‘Antarctica’ comes from a Greek word meaning ‘opposite the north’. Antarctica is a very cold continent and although there are some people temporarily living there for research, nobody lives there permanently. There is a post office on Antarctica, but letters can take up to six weeks to be delivered. Antarctica is home to penguins, seals and other animals that are suited to very cold climates. The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Antarctica and was recorded by a satellite at -93.2 degrees Celsius. The geographic South Pole is located in Antarctica. The explorer, Roald Amundsen, was the first person to reach the South Pole in 1911. 
In this lesson, children will learn that Africa is one of the world’s seven continents. They will continue to expand their geographic vocabulary by learning about the human and physical features of this fascinating continent. Some ideas for activities are suggested below, but teachers are encouraged to adapt these to ensure pupils are challenged. Africa is the world’s second largest continent, Asia being the largest. Like Asia, Africa has huge physical diversity: deserts, grassland, mountains and jungle can all be found in certain parts of Africa. This continent is home to an enormous range of animals, from hippos and hyenas to butterflies and dung beetles. Africa is the oldest inhabited continent on Earth and people have lived there for over five million years.",B1
"Loans are usually used for large purchases such as houses, cars, appliances, or education. 
With loans, you borrow all the money you need – all at once – and pay it back monthly. With loans, you also have to pay interest – but it’s usually less interest than you’d pay with a credit card. It’s good to shop around for a loan with the lowest interest rate. 
So getting a bank loan is a little different than buying with a credit card. (Remember, with a credit card you can charge up to the limit on your card each month – or charge nothing at all. Whatever amount you spend, when you repay it, your full credit limit is available to spend again – but only if you repay it.) 
Financial institutions are more likely to make loans to borrowers who have a good credit history. This means they have demonstrated their ability to repay loans or credit card balances in the past. 
When a consumer takes a loan from a financial institution, the amount of money borrowed is usually a fixed sum. The financial institution sets a rate of interest, minimum monthly payments, and a length of time for the loan. This means you know exactly how much you’re going to have to repay each month, and for how long. 
For any loan amount and interest rate, the longer you take to pay off the loan, the smaller your monthly payment will be – yet the greater the total cost of the loan. It’s important to borrow only what you can afford to repay. 
Before you take a loan, carefully consider both what you can afford to pay on a monthly basis and the total cost of the loan. ",B1
"As the UK’s longest reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II has seen Britain change dramatically over the years. Yet she has remained a constant presence in the lives of the people of the UK and Commonwealth.
Duty and family are very important to her. As a child during the Second World War she inspired the nation. The lessons she learned during these formative years helped her ensure the Royal Family remains a symbol of tradition in the 21st Century.
Princess Elizabeth was born in 1926. Her father Albert – Bertie to family – was George V's second eldest son and did not expect one day to be king.
Elizabeth's mother and father took their royal duties seriously. Though loving parents, they kept with the tradition of not taking their children on royal tours. They left the baby Elizabeth behind when they embarked on a six-month tour of Australia. It was duty first for the young Royal Family.
Elizabeth was four when her sister Margaret was born. The family lived at 145 Piccadilly and the two girls were educated at home.
The young Princess Elizabeth – called Lilibet by her family – often visited her grandfather King George V at his home, Buckingham Palace. They were close, and on one occasion the press attributed George's recovery from a serious illness to spirit-raising visits from his young granddaughter.
Elizabeth's life changed forever when King George V died to be succeeded to the throne by her uncle Edward who then abdicated shortly afterwards.",B1
"Rarely do we consider the tremendous effects of the sun on our daily lives. On a fundamental level, the sun provides light and warmth. Without the sun, the moon would not shine, vegetation would not grow, the earth would freeze, and life as we know it would not exist. The sun gives life to the world. 
Along with the many positive aspects of the sun, however, there are dangerous effects to consider. When spending time under direct sunlight, one must take precautions against ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV rays are invisible light waves that release more energy than any other rays produced by the sun. Two types of UV rays exist within our atmosphere: UVA and UVB. UVA rays do not immediately affect the skin but cause long-term adverse effects, like skin aging, wrinkles, and, in some cases, skin cancer. UVB rays produce immediate negative effects and are the main culprits of sunburns.
Skin protection is extremely important. In an effort to promote a healthy lifestyle, manufacturers of sunblock introduced the Sun Protection Factor (SPF). SPF is the amount of time a person can spend in the sun without burning. As a guide on manufactured sunscreen and sunblock, the indicated SPF, like 15, 30, or 45, shows the amount of protection given by each prospective lotion. Under the SPF scale, if a person’s skin burns after 10 minutes in the sun, the SPF for this person is 10 minutes; hence, if this person used a sunscreen with SPF 15, it would provide 15 times the person’s SPF of 10 minutes, or 150 minutes of protection time. SPF provides a helpful aid in preventing unnecessary health problems from overexposure to sunlight.
If we take the necessary precautions and exercise moderation, we can still have fun in the sun.",B1
"Those who run for election—and risk rejection by the voters—must be motivated to do so.  They also must have the wherewithal to wage a campaign. 
First, of course, they must be legally qualified to serve in Congress or a state legislature.  This entails American citizenship (in half the states), being the required age (between 18 and 30, depending on the office and state), and residency in the state and usually the district. 
Second, they have to be in sync with their districts, if they hope to win. A Democrat has a much better chance in a district where most voters are Democrats; a Republican has a much better chance in a district where most voters are Republicans. 
Third, it helps candidates if they have good reputations and experience in their local community. Most have lived in their communities for a while.  Their base is strengthened by having held local office before running for the state legislature or Congress.  In fact, anywhere from one-third to two-thirds of those elected to the legislature have been mayors, members of municipal councils, county commissioners or served on school boards.  Many also have been involved in social and political organizations locally.  Half the members of the U.S. House had prior service in the state legislature. People in public office tend to rise through the ranks. Fourth, it is important for those who want to be elected to have certain resources.  It helps candidates to want to win badly.  They must be willing to commit the time and energy demanded by a campaign and by the legislative job itself.",B1

 ""Do the scientists really know? Will it happen today, will it ?""
 ""Look, look; see for yourself !""
 The children pressed to each other like so many roses, so many weeds, intermixed, peering out for a look at the hidden sun.
 It rained.
 It had been raining for seven years; thousands upon thousands of days compounded and filled from one end to the other with rain, with the drum and gush of water, with the sweet crystal fall of showers and the concussion of storms so heavy they were tidal waves come over the islands. A thousand forests had been crushed under the rain and grown up a thousand times to be crushed again. And this was the way life was forever on the planet Venus, and this was the schoolroom of the children of the rocket men and women who had come to a raining world to set up civilization and live out their lives.  
""It’s stopping, it’s stopping !"" 
 ""Yes, yes !""
Margot stood apart from them, from these children who could ever remember a time when there wasn’t rain and rain and rain. They were all nine years old, and if there had been a day, seven years ago, when the sun came out for an hour and showed its face to the stunned world, they could not recall. Sometimes, at night, she heard them stir, in remembrance, and she knew they were dreaming and remembering gold or a yellow crayon or a coin large enough to buy the world with. She knew they thought they remembered a warmness, like a blushing in the face, in the body, in the arms and legs and trembling hands.",B1
"There were no shops on this wide street that he was walking along, only a line of tall houses on each side, all them identical. They had porches and pillars and four or five steps going up to their front doors, and it was obvious that once upon a time they had been very swanky residences. But now, even in the darkness, he could see that the paint was peeling from the woodwork on their doors and windows, and that the handsome white façades were cracked and blotchy from neglect.
Suddenly, in a downstairs window that was brilliantly illuminated by a street-lamp not six yards away, Billy caught sight of a printed notice propped up against the glass in one of the upper panes. It said BED AND BREAKFAST. There was a vase of yellow chrysanthemums, tall and beautiful, standing just underneath the notice.
He stopped walking. He moved a bit closer.
Green curtains (some sort of velvety material) were hanging down on either side of the window. The chrysanthemums looked wonderful beside them. He went right up and peered through the glass into the room, and the first thing he saw was a bright fire burning in the hearth. On the carpet in front of the fire, a pretty little dachshund was curled up asleep with its nose tucked into its belly.
The room itself, so far as he could see in the half-darkness, was filled with pleasant furniture. There was a baby-grand piano and a big sofa and several plump armchairs; and in one corner he spotted a large parrot in a cage.",B1
"There are plans afoot to change the laws on treason in the UK, with a commission on citizenship led by Lord Goldsmith recommending reform, but what is the law ?
There is an awful lot of statute law in the UK that deals with treason.
But the most important part was first passed in England in 1351. And it is perhaps one of the few pieces of 14th Century legislation to be regularly discussed in the 21st Century.
What the law actually said was in Norman French, but put succinctly in English, you can't kill, conspire against or wage war against the king and his family. You also can't have sex with his wife, heir's wife or his unmarried eldest daughter. And the act goes on to rule out actions against the chancellor, treasurer and various categories of senior judge.
Treason existed before the 1351 act, but this was the first attempt to set parameters for it, says legal historian Prof Michael Lobban, of Queen Mary, University of London.
""We did have treason before but it wasn't very well defined. There was concern that the crown could manipulate a trial. They wanted to give a precise definition to it.""
And this precise definition in England and Wales - and from 1708 in Scotland - has not changed a great deal over the years, despite a host of other treason acts.",B1
"A continent is a large area of land. Ensure children are able to identify the North and South Poles. Explain that the most southern continent is called Antarctica. Locate Antarctica on a globe and a world map and discuss how its location is the reason why it is so cold. Show children images or video clips of Antarctica. Discuss what children would see/feel/hear if they went there. 
Using a globe, show children that the Earth’s tilt results in Antarctica having a sunny summertime for half of the year, but then a dark winter for the other half of the year. Even though the Earth is orbiting the sun and revolving, its tilt remains the same. This causes Antarctica to face the sun for half of the year, but face away during the other half of the year. Find out about animals that can be found in Antarctica. The land is often colder than the sea, so more life can be found in the icy waters surrounding the continent. Some very small plants grow in Antarctica, but there are no trees or shrubs.
Show children the equator line and explain it is an imaginary line that shows the ‘middle’ of the earth, half way between the North and South Poles. The equator runs right through the continent of Africa. Locate Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. Discuss how the location of Africa results in some parts being very hot.",B1
"A globe shows where there is land and sea on Earth. A continent is a large area of land. There are seven continents on Earth. 
Prior learning assessment: Ask children to label a blank map of the world with the names of continents or any other information they already know. Ensure children know it is just a check on what they already know and that it is fine to leave the page blank if they don’t know anything yet. Using a globe, show children the land masses and the seas. Label a large map of the world on the whiteboard asking children to repeat the names of the continents. Explain that a continent is a large area of land. Show children images of animals, people and places from each continent. Create a ‘passport’ or information book that children will add to during each lesson of this unit. A labelled outline of the continents could be used as a front cover. This could be drawn by the children, traced or an outline could be provided for labelling. Children could write letters to relevant embassies or organisations to ask questions about specific countries. They may receive some interesting responses.

"My hair may have looked better when I left the hairdresser's, but my mind was going round in circles.
Mother and I invited Fred over for dinner that evening. During the meal I asked him if anything had happened to upset Elinor in the spring. 'About Easter,' I said.
'I don't remember anything,' he said. 'Except that she started going to that psychiatrist about then.'
'Why did she go to him, Fred?' mother asked.
'You saw him,' he said. 'He was good-looking. Maybe she liked to look at him instead of me.'
He went home soon after that.
I slept badly and was late for breakfast. Mother had finished reading the newspaper, and I took it.
The report was just a few lines on the back page. It said that Mrs Thompson had been shot the night before!
I couldn't believe it.
I read it again. She was not dead, but her condition was serious. She had been sitting alone outside her house when it happened. Nobody had heard the shot. Her husband found her when he came home at eleven o'clock. She had been shot through the chest and was still not able to make a statement.
'So she knew something that made her dangerous,' I thought. I remembered Margaret going up the steps to the house. Margaret searching for Elinor's lipstick in the street. Margaret, who hated Elinor. And I suddenly remembered Fred's gun, which he kept in his desk drawer, I think it was the gun which finally made me go to the police. The police captain of the station wasn't interested, but a detective came to see me later.

"Once there was a man who was driving in his car at dusk on a Spring evening through part of the forest of Savernake. His name was Mr. Peters. The primroses were just beginning but the trees were still bare, and it was cold; the birds had stopped singing an hour ago. As Mr. Peters entered a straight, empty stretch of road he seemed to hear a faint crying, and a struggling and thrashing, as if somebody was in trouble far away in the trees. He left his car and climbed the mossy bank beside the road. Beyond the bank was an open slope of beech trees leading down to thorn bushes through which he saw the gleam of water.
He stood a moment waiting to try and discover where the noise was coming from, and presently heard a rustling and some strange cries in a voice which was almost human-and yet there was something too hoarse about it at one time and too clear and sweet at another. Mr. Peters ran down the hill and as he neared the bushes he saw something white among them which was trying to extricate itself; coming closer he found that it was a swan that had become entangled in the thorns growing on the bank of the canal.
The bird struggled all the more frantically as he approached, looking at him with hate in its yellow eyes, and when he took hold of it to free it, hissed at him, pecked him, and thrashed dangerously with its wings which were powerful enough to break his arm.",B1
"Asia is the largest and most populous continent in the world. This huge continent borders Africa and Europe to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The highest point in the world, Mount Everest, is found in Asia. In this lesson children should learn to locate Asia on a globe or world map. As in previous lessons, children can continue to develop their understanding of a continent as a huge area of land. When studying Asia, children will discover that the landscape is hugely diverse and ranges from deserts to tropical rainforests, mountains to plains. Asia is home to many interesting animals including tigers, elephants and bears. Asia has many different climates. Some parts of Asia are very dry, such as Aden in the country of Yemen where on average, only 45mm of rain falls each year. Other parts of Asia are very wet, often due to monsoons bringing large amounts of rain. Cherrapunji in Meghalaya State, India, receives on average 11,777mm of rain annually (nearly twelve metres). 
Giant pandas live in the mountains in China. They mainly eat bamboo which is a woody plant. They have thick woolly fur to keep them warm in the mountains.
Orang-utans live on the island of Sumatra. They eat fruit, birds eggs and insects. They can use sticks to get honey from bees nests. They are endangered animals.
Asian elephants have trunks made of muscle that they use for feeding, watering, touching, washing and gripping. They eat  plants and need to drink water every day.
Male peafowl are called peacocks and females are called peahens. Peacocks have bright blue and green feathers. They eat berries, grains and sometimes small snakes and lizards.",B1
"In this lesson, children will learn about the smallest of the world’s continents: Australia. People in the Northern Hemisphere often refer to Australia as being ‘down under’ due to its location in the Southern Hemisphere. The continent of Australia usually refers to mainland Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania and New Guinea. There are many other islands in the region of the Central and South Pacific Ocean and these are sometimes known collectively as Oceania. For Year One, it is sufficient for children to locate Australia and be able to recall some key facts. Understanding exactly which countries are included within the continent of Australia can be a focus for future years. Australia is home to some animals that cannot be found elsewhere such as kangaroos, koalas and wallabies. The reason Australia has so many unique species is because the land mass has not been connected to anywhere else for millions of years. This long stretch of time has allowed species to develop and adapt in a distinct way. 
Recap prior learning asking children what they have learned about continents so far. Introduce Australia as the seventh and final continent that children will learn about. Identify Australia on a map/globe and discuss its location in the Southern Hemisphere. Explain that the continent of Australia includes the huge landmass of Australia and some surrounding islands. Explain that millions of years ago the landmass of Australia was connected to other continents. Over time, Australia moved very slowly away from the other continents. Australia has not been connected to any other land masses for millions of years. This isolation has allowed animals to grow and change in their own way, making them very different from animals living on other continents. Share and discuss some images and video clips.",B1
"Nevertheless he managed to release it from the thorns, and carrying it tightly with one arm, holding the snaky head well away with the other hand (for he did not wish his eyes pecked out), he took it to the verge of the canal and dropped it in.
The swan instantly assumed great dignity and sailed out to the middle of the water, where it put itself to rights with much dabbling and preening, smoothing its feathers with little showers of drops. Mr. Peters waited to make sure that it was all right and had suffered no damage in its struggles. Presently the swan, when it was satisfied with its appearance, floated in to the bank once more. and in a moment, instead of the great white bird, there was a little man all in green with ~ golden crown and long beard, standing by the water. He had fierce glittering eyes and looked by no means friendly.
""Well, Sir,"" he said threateningly, ""I see you are presumptuous enough to know some of the laws of magic. You think that because you have rescued-by pure good fortune-the King of the Forest from a difficulty, you should have some fabulous reward.""
""I expect three wishes, no more and no less,"" answered Mr. Peters, looking at him steadily and with composure.
""Three wishes, he wants, the clever man~ Well, I have yet to hear of the human being who made any good use of his three wish they mostly end up worse off than they started. Take your three wishes then"" he flung three dead leaves in the air ""and don't blame me if you spend the last wish in undoing the work of the other two.""",B1
"It was the last day of the Beta shift. Gareth was in his room. In half an hour it was going to be time to go to the Freezer Room. Gareth got into the shower. Very carefully he put the earring on the shower tray where he had found it. Then he took a small white flower and put it down next to the earring. He hoped the cleaners would be too lazy to check the shower. They hadn't checked it last month. The small flower was from a lemon tree. If the cleaners found it, there would be trouble. It was forbidden to pick flowers from the garden area. Nobody had seen Gareth when he picked it earlier in the day.
When Gareth got to the Freezer Room the door was closed. A starship policeman was standing outside.
'You'll have to wait for a few minutes,' said the policeman. 'We're having a small problem.'
Gareth could hear screams from inside the room.
'What's wrong?' he said.
'I shouldn't tell you,' said the policeman, 'but it's one of the cooks. He doesn't want to go in the freezer. He's frightened. He says he wants to stay awake until we get to Orelia Five.'
'What's happening?' said Gareth.
'What do you think?' said the policeman. 'We're putting him in the freezer. If he's still making trouble when he wakes up in two weeks, we'll have to ... well, you know what we'll have to do.'
Gareth knew. Five minutes later the door opened. Gareth went in and walked towards the freezers. He climbed into one. Before he started to fall asleep he thought about Alpha 3461. 'I wonder if she uses the same freezer, too?'

"I arrived at eleven the following night. The signalman was waiting for me with his light. 'You see, I didn't call out,' I said, smiling. We walked to the signal box and sat down by the fire.
'I've decided to tell you what disturbs me,' he began in a quiet voice. 'Yesterday evening I thought you were somebody else.'
'Who?' I asked.
'I don't know.'
'Does he look like me?'
'I've never seen his face because his left arm is always in front of it. He waves his right arm - like this.' And he waved violently, like somebody trying to say, 'Please get out of the way!'
'One night,' continued the signalman, 'the moon was shining and I was sitting here. Suddenly I heard a voice - ""Hello, down there!"" I went to the door and looked out. There was somebody by the red light near the tunnel and he was waving. ""Look out! Look out!"" he shouted, and then again, ""Hello, down there! Look out!"" I took my lamp and ran towards him. ""What's wrong? What's happened?"" I called. I wondered why he had his arm in front of his eyes. As I came near him, I put out my hand to pull his arm away - but he wasn't there.'
'Did he go into the tunnel?' I asked.
'No. I ran into the tunnel. I stopped and shone my lamp around, but there was nobody there. I was scared, so I ran out fast and came to my box. I sent a telegraph message - ""Alarm received. Is anything wrong?"" The answer came back: ""All well.""'

    “Yes Ma’am, we will.” 
    Parker looked at the clock on the wall. It was just after two. “Constable Shepton!”
    “Sir ?”
    “Put out a message to all cars. Look out for a dark blue Escort, registration number J47 HGK. Driver’s a young lad of 17 called Paul Hoskins - just passed his test. His mum expected him home before midnight. Hasn’t shown up .”
    “Any idea where he is ?”
    “Went out for the evening with his girlfriend. She’s not home either .”
    “What’s the problem then, Sarge?” asked Shepton. “Probably out clubbing! If we had to look for every youngster who stayed out late... ”
    “Yes, I know. But his mum says he’d promised to be back home by midnight. “ 
    “Yes, but... ”
    “Seems like he’s a sensible lad, who does what he’s told. And the lass is only 15 .”

"Here is the car of the future! This car is the opposite of todays' cars; today's cars are noisy and dirty, this one is silent and clean. Today's cars have wheels, this one does not. It moves like a snail, but much faster than a snail!
    This car will use electric energy, not petrol or gasoline; it will have batteries that can be recharged instantly from chargers in the road. It will also be very easy to drive.
    In fact, you won't need to drive it; it will drive itself. You will just need to tell the computer: ""Go to X"" and the car will go there. Also, it will reach X very quickly, much faster than today's cars. It will also be very safe and comfortable.
    A lot of the technology already exists, but it is very experimental.  Already today scientists are developing new materials for the surface of roads: In fifty years from now, perhaps sooner, some new roads will capture solar energy : they will store this energy under the road, and some cars will be able to use it.
    However you probably won't ever drive a ""snail car"", even if you're under 20 today. This, perhaps, is the car of the year 2100, the car that your grandchildren will maybe drive.
    Driving will be nice in the 22nd century ! No pollution, no traffic-jams, no stress.
    If, of course, we reach the 22nd century...With all today's problems of global warming, pollution, and natural resources, nothing is certain any more. Scientists have lots of ideas about the car of the future: but the future itself is perhaps less sure...

"In my cabin I thought of the tall man, now dead somewhere in the ocean, and I opened the curtains around his berth. It was empty. Suddenly I noticed that the window was open and secured with a hook. Angry, I went to look for the steward. I showed him the window.
'Why is it open?' I shouted. 'I'll report you to the captain.'
'The steward was frightened and he closed the window. 'Nobody can keep this window closed at night, sir. Look, is that locked or not? You try it and see, please.'
'The window was securely locked.
'Well, you'll see that in half an hour it'll be open again - and secured, too. That's the horrible thing, sir - it is secured with the hook!'
'I checked the window again. 'If I find it open in the night, I'll give you ten pounds. But it's impossible.'
We said goodnight, and I went to bed. I tried to sleep, but I couldn't. Sometimes I looked at the window; it was closed, and I smiled thinking of the steward's story. As I was falling asleep, I suddenly felt some cold air and sea water on my face. I jumped out of bed, and the movement of the ship threw me onto the sofa under the window. It was open - and secured with the hook! I was surprised but not scared. I closed the window and locked it. Then I stood watching it in the dark cabin.
'Suddenly I heard a sound behind me and turned round. A sound of pain came from the berth above mine. I opened the curtain and put my hand in: there was somebody in it!

"Holmes went out for the morning, but he came back at lunch-time. We then went by train into the country, and took a taxi to Dr Roylott's house. 'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'our dangerous friend Roylott needs the girls' money, because he only has 750 pounds a year from his dead wife. I found that out this morning. But the gipsies, the whistle, the band - they are more difficult to understand, but I think I have an answer.'
When we arrived, Helen Stoner showed us the three bedrooms. We saw her room first.
'Why are they mending your bedroom wall?' asked Holmes. 'There's nothing wrong with it.'
'You're right,' she said. 'I think it was a plan to move me into my sister's room.'
'Yes,' said Holmes. We went into Julia's room, and Holmes looked at the windows carefully.
'Nobody could come in from outside,' he said. Then he looked round the room. 'Why is that bell-rope there, just over the bed?'
'My stepfather put it there two years ago. It's for calling a servant, but Julia and I never used it because we didn't have any servants. He also put in that air-vent on the wall between his room and this one.'
Holmes pulled the rope. 'But it doesn't work,' he said. 'How strange! And it's just over the air-vent. That also is interesting. Why have an air-vent on an inside wall? Air-vents are usually on outside walls.'
Then we went into Dr Roylott's room. Holmes saw a large metal box near the wall.

"From the days of Columbus on, explorers and cartographers made maps of the New World. The two maps below were made in 1636 and 1651. For context, recall that the Jamestown colony in Virginia was founded in 1608 and that the Mayflower landed in New England in 1620. Both of these maps show Virginia, but they portray it very differently. Compare the maps, and consider why two maps of the same area would be so different.
By the 1630s, Englishmen had settled in two main areas of the new world—New England and Virginia. The two regions were very different—New England was settled by Puritan religious dissidents while Virginian society revolved around growing and selling tobacco. The people living in the two colonies were different, as well.
Each ship that came to the colonies included a list of passengers and some information about them. The following two passenger lists—one for Massachusetts and one for Virginia—provide an indication of the different types of people who came to the two colonies.
New England was first settled by Puritans, people from England who believed that the Church of England had become corrupt. Their name comes from their intention to purify the Church. The first group of settlers, who came on the Mayflower and founded the Plymouth colony, were called separatists. They wanted to leave the Church entirely. A decade later, a second group of Puritans founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but they were less radical. Instead of separating from the Church, they wanted to remain members of the church and purify it from within. The following documents are taken from this second group of settlers. As you read, think about how their beliefs might have influence their actions in New England and helped shape the new colony.

"Owning your own business is part of the American Dream. You might be wondering how a person could start their own company. What steps should be taken? How much money do you need to have saved up prior to starting a business? As a high school student, this possibility might seem more like an impossibility. In order to start the process of running your own operation, the first thing to do is throw all doubt out the window. The next step is obtaining a great education!
High schools all over the United States have classes dedicated to teaching business, marketing, and economics. These classes cover all of the basics needed to start you on your path to success. When taking such classes, a variety of topics will be covered. For instance, economics are a large part of learning about business. In an economics course, you learn more about the various markets in the world, supply and demand, and how the markets fluctuate. You will also need to take some financing courses. These will cover the money basics and how it is important to save money, invest money, and even how to spend money (wisely, of course). Other important business classes include accounting, human resources, operations management, and information and technology management.
If you are truly interested in the world of business, you might consider taking courses over the summer months, just to keep your mind fresh and full of the most up-to-date information. As an exercise, you might even consider creating your own business plan. How do you do this? It is simple, really. Start with an idea that you think could be profitable. The next step in creating your very own company plan is to write a mission statement.",B1
"Then Mr Grant Munro left, and Holmes and I discussed the case. 'I am afraid that this is a case of blackmail,' said Holmes.
'And who is the blackmailer?' I asked.
'Well, it must be that creature with the yellow face. Upon my word, Watson, there is something very attractive about that yellow face at the window, and I would not miss this case for worlds.'
'Have you got a theory?' I asked.
'Yes,' Holmes replied, 'I think her first husband is in the cottage. This is what I think happened: this woman was married in America. Her husband got a terrible disease. That is why he has that horrible yellow face. She ran away from him at last, and came back to England, where she changed her name and started a new life. After three years of marriage, she feels safe again, but her first husband, or some unscrupulous woman attached to him, discovers where she lives. They write to her and tell her to send them a hundred pounds, or they will tell her new husband everything. When her husband tells her that someone is living in the cottage, she knows that they are her blackmailers. In the middle of the night, while her husband is sleeping, she decides to go to the cottage. That night she is not able to convince her blackmailers to leave her alone, so she returns the next day. That was when her husband saw her coming out of the house. She then promises her husband that she will not return, but she wants to get rid of her blackmailers. She decides to go again, and this time she brings a photograph, which they probably asked her for.

" Many people like to see celebrities; but celebrities don't usually like being looked at - at least, not all day every day!
    There is, however, one place in England where you can look at celebrities - lots of them - every day: this is Madame Tussaud's, the most popular tourist attraction in London.
    On most days of the year, queues of visitors can be seen outside Madame Tussaud's, all wanting to get in and see some of the most famous people in the world - kings and queens, politicians, stars, and even famous criminals. They are all inside, just waiting to be looked at, or talked to.
    If you like, you can talk to film stars, politicians and even tyrants in Madame Tussaud's, but they won't say anything to you, because they can't! Madame Tussaud's is a wax-works, and the ""famous people"" in the building are really made out of wax.
    Judging by the popularity of Madame Tussaud's, that does not seem to be a problem! Ordinary people like looking at extraordinary people, even if they are only statues. It's better than nothing!
    Marie Tussaud was born in Strasbourg in 1765. As a child she learned how to make wax models of people, and later went to Paris. Then in 1802 she moved to England, touring round the country with her exhibition of wax figures. In 1835 (aged 70!), she finally settled in London. ""Madame Tussaud's"" has been one of the city's most popular exhibitions ever since.
    Naturally, the collection has changed and grown; Indeed, it keeps changing all the time. While there are some historic figures that do not change, others come and go, and others are ""aged"" as the years go by.

"Key Points Credit 
To put it simply, credit is about borrowing money. Credit refers to the ability of a person or a business to borrow money from a lender with the intent, or promise, to pay the money back. 
With loans and credit cards, people are able to borrow the money they need in order to buy something now. 
Earning credit requires earning people’s trust. When you borrow money from a parent, guardian, neighbor or friend, you usually promise to pay it back by a certain time. They lend you the money because they trust you to keep your promise. The same holds true when you borrow from a bank. 
Taking personal responsibility is absolutely essential when it comes to credit. Taking personal responsibility means keeping your promise to pay back the money you owe. 
Not everyone can borrow money from a bank. Credit is a privilege – and it’s granted only to those who have demonstrated their ability to manage their money over time. This is called your credit history. 
You can establish credit by opening a savings or checking account and carefully managing it. Careful management of a checking account means you don’t write checks for more money than you have (which is known as writing bad checks). Lots of teens have already started the process of establishing credit by opening savings and checking accounts. Nearly two of every three teenagers of high school age have savings accounts, and about one in five has a checking account. 
Building good credit is the key to getting the things you want – a car, college education, or a house. It’s important to maintain a good credit history. ",B1
"Credit Cards 
At age 21, you may be able to have a credit card in your own name. To do so, you will need to show the lender that you can use a credit card responsibly. First, the lender will want to know your income, or how much money you earn for your work. Second, they’ll want to see if you have a history of paying your bills on time. This information helps the lender determine whether they can have confidence in you to repay your debts. 
Most lenders charge a fee for lending money. This fee varies and is referred to as “interest.” (When you deposit money in a savings account, the bank pays you interest. But when you borrow money from the bank, you pay interest to the bank.) The amount of interest on credit is usually considerably higher than the interest paid by a financial institution on savings accounts. This is one way that banks and other financial institutions make money. 
The interest rate on loans is expressed as an annual percentage rate, or APR. The APR is the yearly cost of a loan stated as a percentage of the loan amount. It reflects the interest rate and other fees required to make the loan. 
Using a credit card is like getting a short-term loan from a bank. If you pay back the full amount you spend each month, the bank will not charge you interest, and the credit card is merely a convenient tool to use. However, if you do not pay the full amount each month, the bank will charge you interest on the unpaid portion, and this can get very costly! ",B1
"Youth crime and vandalism in the Patchway district of Bristol have fallen by 20% in just a few months. Why? Because young people have stopped encouraging each other to do stupid and antisocial things, and are now making sure that they keep out of trouble. And it's all the result of a new football league!
""Peer pressure"" is a strong force, specially among young people. Almost everyone can remember a moment when they have felt compelled to do something because their friends were doing it, or to buy something because their friends had bought it.
Without peer pressure, fashion would not be the same, and advertising would be much harder. There would also be fewer of today's big social problems: drugs, crime and so on. Yet although peer pressure is usually seen as a bad influence, it can also produce positive results.
Jon Owen and David Morgan, two Bristol policemen, have organised a six-a-side football league for teenagers in Patchway, one of the poorest parts of the city. Police in several parts of Britain organise similar football leagues or competitions, but usually the aim is just to keep teens occupied, and build confidence between teenagers and the police. Jon and Dave, however, had a better idea.
They have introduced a system in which football results are linked to young people's behaviour off the pitch. Teams score points for winning their matches, but lose points if any team-member does anything he shouldn't... on the football field or off it! Teams score ten points for winning a match, and five if they draw; but if any player is arrested, the team loses ten points. If a member is caught doing an act of vandalism, such as spraying graffiti, the team loses five points.

"But after a few noisy scuffles in which he knocked a picture off the wall, scratched the piano, and smashed a lamp, we just gave in—only to discover that, left to his own devices, he hopped up and down as delicately as a ballet dancer.
It’s not just our own dogs that bother me. The dogs I meet at parties are even worse. I don’t know what I’ve got that attracts them; it just doesn’t bear thought. My husband swears I rub chopped meat on my ankles. But at every party it’s the same thing. I am sitting with a group in front of the fire when all of a sudden the large mutt of the host appears in the archway. Then, without a single bark of warning, he hurls himself upon me. He settles down peacefully on my lap. I blow out such quantities of hair as I haven’t swallowed and glance at my host, expecting to be rescued. He murmurs, “Isn’t that wonderful? You know, Brucie is usually so distant with strangers.”
At a dinner party last week, after I had been mugged by a large sheepdog, I announced quite piteously, “Oh dear, he seems to have swallowed one of my earrings.” The hostess looked really distressed for a moment, until she examined the remaining earring. Then she said, “Oh, I think it will be all right. It’s small and round.”
Nowadays if I go anywhere I just ask if they have a dog. If they do, I say, “Maybe I’d better keep away from him—I have this bad allergy.” This does not really charm the lady of the house. In fact, she behaves rather as though she’d just discovered that I was back in analysis for my kleptomania. But it is safer. It really is.",B1
"Checking accounts, like savings accounts, are part of an individual’s personal money management system. Checking accounts are very similar to savings accounts. Both types of accounts keep your money safe, and both are very easy to access if you need cash. 
Checking accounts are designed to be day-in and day-out money-management tools, while savings accounts are designed for long-term money-management. Unlike savings accounts, banks expect people to make frequent withdrawals and deposits to checking accounts. 
An important difference between checking and savings accounts is that checking accounts come with checks! 
A second important difference is that most savings accounts earn interest, while many checking accounts do not. 
Checks can be used to make purchases, just like cash, and they help people pay bills or make simple purchases without carrying around cash or sending it through the mail. People use checks for rent, groceries, clothes. 
Checks are legal documents that function like cash. Knowing how to write a check correctly is fundamental to good money management. 
It’s important for students to understand that in order to write a check, there must be sufficient funds in the checking account to cover the amount. Writing a check when you know there is not enough money in the account to cover it is a violation of the law. This is called writing a “bad check.” Individuals who write “bad checks” may be fined or otherwise punished. When you write a check or make a deposit to your checking account, it’s very important that you immediately record that transaction in your check register. That way, you will keep track of how much money you have available in your account, and avoid writing a “bad check.” ",B1
"Many parts of London will be under water by 2060, if nothing is done to protect them. London on the Thames, yes; but London in the Sea? No thank you!  Yet this could  happen before 2060, unless steps are taken quite quickly, to prevent it.
   As a result of global warming, the sea level around the south east corner of England is expected to rise by 54 cms in just half a century! And scientists now say that many parts of London will be at serious risk from flooding by the sea within 50 years.
   It's not all of London that is in danger; just some parts to the east of the city. And they won't be under water all the time; just when there are very high tides. 
    The low-lying suburbs beside the Thames in the East End of London are already protected from high tides by a massive barrier that stretches right across the river; but more defences will be needed along the banks of the Thames to protect a larger area to the north of the river, and further east.  And no-one really knows if the existing Thames Barrier will still be enough to protect London, even in 2050.
   The Thames barrier was opened in 1982. During the first ten years of its life, it was closed, on average, just once a year. Some years it was never closed at all. Between 2000 and 2013, it was closed an average of almost six times a year; and in the year 2013-2014, it was closed 50 times... in twelve months. The level of the sea is getting steadily higher, that is certain.

"The first written story of the Loch Ness monster is in a text written in the year 565AD by a Celtic biographer: this writer describes how a man was attacked by a monster while he was swimming in the river Ness. Perhaps the legend already existed in those days: it has certainly existed for many centuries in Scottish folklore.
    However, the story of the monster was not very well-known in England for one simple reason: Loch Ness is a very long way from the rest of Britain. Until the age of the railway, very few people ever went to the Highlands of Scotland...except soldiers or officials from the cities of the Scottish Lowlands. No-one else had any reason to go there: the north of Scotland was wild and desolate, wet and generally cold, and inhabited more by sheep than by people.
   The myth became big news in 1930; three men, out in a boat on the lake, said that they had seen a monster. Immediately, several other people said that they had seen one too. In 1933, a man took the first ""photo"" of the monster, from a distance of about 100 metres. The photo was not clear, but Kodak said that the photo was real. The most famous photo of all was taken in 1934 by a London surgeon; it seems to show a long neck and a small head sticking up out of the water. ""Nessie"" - if the photo is real - looks something like a dinosaur.
    A lot of other photos have been taken since then, but none of them have been clear. Obviously, if there is a monster, it is a shy one! It doesn't often come to the surface, and it never does so near the shore on a sunny afternoon in summer!

"Welsh footballing legend John Charles has been honoured in a new set of stamps celebrating 150 years of the Football Association.
The Swansea-born striker and centre-back, who died in 2004, is regarded as one of Wales' greatest players.
He is one of 11 football heroes from Wales, Northern Ireland, England and Scotland to feature on the new stamps.
They have been illustrated by artist Andrew Kinsman, who based his work on photographs of the players.
He then created a composite artwork, so that when the 11 stamps are placed together, they form a traditional team shot.
The 11 players selected were chosen for their outstanding record on the pitch and representation of their home country.
Charles left his home city of Swansea to sign for Leeds at the age of 17 and settled in the city after his football career was over.
He joined Juventus for a then-British-record fee of £65,000 in 1957, winning three championships and the Italian cup in five years at the club.
Charles, known as the Gentle Giant, also played for Cardiff City, Roma, Hereford United, Merthyr Tydfil and represented Wales at the World Cup in Sweden in 1958.
Jonathan Ford, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales, said: ""All football supporters, not just in Wales, will be delighted with the news that John Charles is to be honoured and recognised in this way.
""John Charles has been described as a world class centre forward and a world class centre half.
""He was also a true gentleman, who showed terrific respect to everyone.
""A proud Welshman, one of the true greats without doubt.""",B1
"The first recorded contact between Europeans and the Blackfoot people took place around 1754. Alexander Henday was an explorer for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). He tried unsuccessfully to get the Blackfoot to trade with the Company. At first, the Blackfoot did not need to trade with the Europeans; the Blackfoot felt they had everything they needed at home. They preferred traditional local trade among the First Nations. As the European fur traders moved farther inland, the Blackfoot entered into direct trade with them.
The horse had a major impact on the Blackfoot people. They used to follow the bison on foot. Now, horses allowed the Blackfoot to travel, hunt, and trade in a larger area. The Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company tried to encourage the Blackfoot to expand their territory and become part of the European fur trade network.
The Blackfoot Confederacy was an alliance among the Piikani, Kainai, and Siksika peoples. The Tsuu T'ina people joined later. Primarily a military alliance, it was greatly feared by its enemies. Before contact, the Confederacy controlled much of the Prairie region of what are now Canada and the U.S. The Cree and Assiniboine lived farther north, in rich fur-gathering territory, and became active trade partners with the French and British. They acquired firearms from their European trading partners in the process. They gradually began to push south into Confederacy territory. This led to the Battle of the Belly River between the Cree and the Confederacy in 1870, near what is now Lethbridge. This is considered to have been the last battle between First Nations in North America.",B1
"A long time ago there lived, in Pennsylvania, a little boy whose name
was Benjamin West.

This boy loved pictures. Indeed, there were few things that he loved
more. But he had never seen any pictures except a few small ones in
a book. His father and mother were Quakers, and they did not think it
was right to spend money for such things. They thought that pictures
might take one's mind away from things that were better or more useful.

One day Benjamin's mother had to go to a neighbor's on some errand.
So she told Benjamin to stay in the house and take care of his baby
sister till she came back.

He was glad to do this; for he loved the baby.

waken her. For some time he sat very still. He heard the clock ticking.
He heard the birds singing. He began to feel a little lonesome.

A fly lighted on the baby's cheek, and he brushed it away. Then he
thought what a pretty picture might be made of his sister's sweet face
and little hands.

no pencil, but there was a piece of black charcoal on the hearth. How
pretty the baby was! He began to draw. The baby smiled but did not

"At five o'clock on a September afternoon Ronald Torbay was making preparations for his third murder. He was being very careful. He realized that murdering people becomes more dangerous if you do it often.
He was in the bathroom of the house that he had recently rented. For a moment he paused to look in the mirror. The face that looked back at him was thin, middle-aged and pale. Dark hair, a high forehead and well-shaped blue eyes. Only the mouth was unusual - narrow and quite straight. Even Ronald Torbay did not like it.
A sound in the kitchen below worried him. Was Edyth coming up to have her bath before he had prepared it for her? No, it was all right; she was going out of the back door. From the window he saw her disappearing round the side of the house into the garden. It was exactly like all the other gardens in the long street. He didn't like her to be alone there.

He was very careful to choose the right type of woman: someone who would not make friends quickly in a new place.

"It was just after dark one windy evening in the autumn of 1844. I was with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in the library of his Paris apartment. For one hour at least we had been sitting in profound silence. Dupin seemed content just to watch the smoke rising from his pipe. As for myself, I was thinking about the affair of the Rue Morgue. More particularly I was thinking about how quickly Dupin had solved the case when the police could do nothing. It was therefore something of a coincidence when our old acquaintance Monsieur G of the Paris police arrived at the door.
G explained that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business that had caused a great deal of trouble.
""And what is the difficulty now?"" I asked. ""No more murders, I hope?""
""Oh no, nothing like that. The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I am sure we can manage it ourselves. But I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of the case, because it is so very odd.""
""Simple and odd."" said Dupin.
""Yes, in a way, though not exactly. The fact is, we have all been extremely puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet... we cannot understand it.""
""Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the case which you do not understand,"" said my friend.
""What nonsense you talk sometimes, Monsieur Dupin,"" said the Prefect, laughing.
""Perhaps the mystery is a little too simple,"" Dupin continued.

"A sheet of rain moved across Placid Cove Trailer Park.
Lightning made a complicated pattern in the night sky. Nudger held his umbrella against the wind as he walked, and pulled a piece of paper from his pocket to check the address of the trailer he was trying to find. Finally, he found Number 307 and knocked on its metal door.
'I'm Nudger,' he said, when the door opened.
The woman in the doorway stared at him. Rain blew in, making wet marks on her pale blue dress and ruffling her blond hair. She was tall but very thin. She looked at first to be about twelve years old, but a second glance showed her to be in her middle twenties. She had blue eyes, a large mouth, and top teeth that rested on her bottom lip when she wasn't talking.

'It is,' Nudger agreed. 'And it's raining on me.'
Her whole body gave a quick, nervous movement as she smiled to apologize. 'I'm Holly Ann Adams, Mr Nudger. And yes, you are getting wet. Come in.'

Holly Ann moved a pile of magazines from a chair. Nudger folded his umbrella and sat down. She started to speak, then there was that same nervous movement again, as if she'd remembered something, and she walked over and switched off the TV.

"In the city of Corinth there once lived a wonderful musician whose name was Arion. No other person could play on the lyre or sing so sweetly as he; and
the songs which he composed were famous in many lands.

The king of Corinth was his friend. The people of Corinth never grew
tired of praising his sweet music.

One summer he went over the sea to Italy; for his name was well known

to make plans to get it.

""The easiest way,"" said the captain, ""is to throw him overboard. Then
there will be no one to tell tales.""

Arion overheard them plotting.

""You may take everything that I have,"" he said, ""if you will only spare
my life.""

But they had made up their minds to get rid of him. They feared to
spare him lest he should report the matter to the king.

"When Andrew Jackson was a little boy he lived with his mother in South
Carolina. He was eight years old when he heard about the ride of Paul
Revere and the famous fight at Lexington.

It was then that the long war, called the Revolutionary War, began.
The king's soldiers were sent into every part of the country. The
people called them the British. Some called them ""red-coats.""

There was much fighting; and several great battles took place between
the British and the Americans.

At last Charleston, in South Carolina, was taken by the British. Andrew
Jackson was then a tall white-haired boy, thirteen years old.

""I am going to help drive those red-coated British out of the country,""
he said to his mother.

Then, without another word, he mounted his brother's little farm horse
and rode away. He was not old enough to be a soldier, but he could be
a scout--and a good scout he was.

He was very tall--as tall as a man. He was not afraid of anything. He
was strong and ready for every duty.

One day as he was riding through the woods, some British soldiers saw
him. They quickly surrounded him and made him their prisoner.

""Come with us,"" they said, ""and we will teach you that the king's
soldiers are not to be trifled with.""

They took him to the British camp.

""What is your name, young rebel?"" said the British captain.

""Andy Jackson.""

""Well, Andy Jackson, get down here and clean the mud from my boots.""

Andrew's gray eyes blazed as he stood up straight and proud before the
haughty captain.

""Sir,"" he said, ""I am a prisoner of war, and demand to be treated as
such.""

"The man of whom I am now going to tell you was famous, not for his
wealth or his power or his deeds in war, but for his great gentleness.
He lived more than seven hundred years ago in a quaint little town of
Italy. His name was Francis, and because of his goodness, all men now
call him Saint Francis.

Very kind and loving was Saint Francis - kind and loving not only to men
but to all living things. He spoke of the birds as his little brothers
of the air, and he could never bear to see them harmed.

At Christmas time he scattered crumbs of bread under the trees, so
that the tiny creatures could feast and be happy.

Once when a boy gave him a pair of doves which he had snared, Saint
Francis had a nest made for them, and the mother bird laid her eggs
in it.

By and by, the eggs hatched, and a nestful of young doves grew up.
They were so tame that they sat on the shoulders of Saint Francis and
ate from his hand.

And many other stories are told of this man's great love and pity for
the timid creatures which lived in the fields and woods.

One day as he was walking among the trees the birds saw him and flew
down to greet him. They sang their sweetest songs to show how much
they loved him. Then, when they saw that he was about to speak, they
nestled softly in the grass and listened.

"If there is one thing that unites almost the whole population of Canada, it is the experience of winter.
    While in most parts of Europe, people never know what the winter weather will be like from one week to the next, Canadians know what winter means. When the last leaves fall off the trees in Autumn, Canadians know that the winter is coming, and that it will be cold; or if it is not cold, it will be very cold! When the Arctic air blows south in the winter months, Canadians know that the temperature will fall to -20° or lower, perhaps down to -40°; but because they know that it is going to happen, Canadians are ready for it! That, as they say, is half the battle of survival!
    In Edmonton, the biggest city in the province of Alberta, the first winter snows can come in October.  When this happens, Edmontonians complain that it is a bit early, but then just got on with normal life.
     For most of the winter, which usually lasts from November to April, daytime temperatures in the city rarely rise above freezing; from time to time, Arctic winds howl down from the north, and for several days temperatures in the city may not rise above -20° (and may drop below -40°). But in a city where people are used to cold winters, life carries on as usual. Canadians have to know how to cope with the cold; those who can't have just two options, to emigrate or to go and live beyond the Rocky Mountains, beside the Pacific Ocean, in ""B.C.""  – British Columbia!
    The easiest way to keep away from the cold of a Canadian winter is to stay indoors as much as possible!

"Faced with John’s abandonment of the Charter, the rebels abandoned it too, and attempted a totally different solution. They deposed the king and offered the throne instead to Prince Louis (1187-1228), the eldest son of the King of France, Philip Augustus (1180–1223). When Louis landed in England in May 1216, he issued a proclamation which said nothing about the Charter. His promise of new monarchy, untainted with the oppression associated with John and his predecessors, was enough. Magna Carta now seemed a failure without a future. What saved the Charter was John’s death in October 1216. He left his nine-year-old son, Henry III (r.1216–72), in a terrible situation, for Louis was now controlling over half the country. The governors of Henry III thus took a momentous decision, one which shaped the future course of history. In order to tempt rebels back into Henry’s camp, they decided to accept what John had rejected and Louis had ignored. In November 1216, as almost their first act, they issued a new version of Magna Carta. Evidently they judged that the Charter, despite its abandonment, would have a great appeal. Their decision is readily explicable. In its short life the Charter had already sunk deep roots into the hearts and minds of the political community. In 1215 official versions had been distributed to the bishops. This is why, of the four surviving originals of the 1215 Charter, two remain in the possession of cathedrals — those of Lincoln and Salisbury — while a third (as recent research has shown) was held at Canterbury Cathedral before later finding its way into the collections of the British Library. Just as important, there was a wide distribution of unofficial versions of the Charter. These were probably derived from drafts produced during the negotiations at Runnymede.",B2
"Rebellion itself was nothing new. On several occasions under the Norman kings, barons and churchmen who considered the king tyrannical or excessive in his demands for tax rose up to demand redress. This had most recently occurred in a great rebel coalition of 1173–74 against King Henry II (r. 1154-89). The problem here was that Henry’s resources vastly outweighed those of his opponents. Consequently the rebellion of 1173-74 had resulted not in baronial victory but in a further leap forwards for royal power, the placing of Scotland under English control, and the claim by the King to extend his laws and taxes to yet further territory. The disappearance of Arthur of Brittany changed all this. Tired of their lands being treated as a war zone, the barons of western France now rebelled against John, demanding justice. The French King, Philip Augustus (r. 1180–1223), posed as leader of their movement. John refused to attend trial at the French royal court. In consequence, Philip declared that John had forfeited all title to his lands in France. As far south as the Loire, the Plantagenet empire collapsed. Henceforth, the Capetians ruled in Normandy. John himself slunk back to England, his reputation in tatters. For the rest of his life, the determination to reconquer his lost lands was to poison relations between king and English barons. Faced with rising demands for tax, the barons grew increasingly disenchanted with their king.",B2
"Differences over an issue or policy, such as abortion, guns, capital punishment or environmental regulation often are, of course, not important in a legislative body. What is also important are priorities or choices among items that nearly everyone favors. Differences among priorities, among goods (that is, items that legislators are positive about) are common in the legislature’s appropriations process, by which a budget for the state is adopted. The most important questions involve whether to spend more on health programs, more on correctional programs, or more on whatever other programs may be worthy of additional funds. This activity is designed to help students see these differences for themselves and better understand the deliberations, negotiations and settlements that occur in the legislative process.
Objectives 
1. To understand and appreciate a few of the basic practices of democracy: 
• That people have different values, interests and opinions. 
• These differences are often settled by means of deliberation and negotiation, with compromise and a majority vote as key elements. 
2. To explore differences often confronted by state legislatures when enacting a state budget. 
Concepts 
Deliberation  A conversation by two or more sides on an issue in which each side tries to persuade the other of the merits of its position, and each side is generally open to persuasion. 
Negotiation This practice does not involve the substantive merits of the issue, or one side convincing the other that it is right. Rather, negotiation is an activity in which two sides with different positions try to resolve their differences by a variety of techniques such as compromise.  
Decision Whether deliberations and/or negotiations are used to reach a settlement, it is necessary to know when that settlement has been reached.  In democratic politics that normally means voting.",B2
"$200 million additional funding is required to begin increasing security in the state. According to a study completed by a blue-ribbon commission, federal aid and federal programs are insufficient for the potential threats facing the state. Bridges, tunnels and highways need substantial security improvements. A plan has been adopted; now it is necessary to implement the plan. Support is widespread. 
The problem, however, is that the budget—which, according to the state constitution, must be in balance—is facing a shortfall because of the economic recession. Tax revenues are down and either budget expenditures will have to be cut or taxes increased, or some combination of the two. The appropriations committee has to cut or raise $500 million. Cuts can be distributed among one, two, three or all four of the subcommittees. Increasing the sales tax by two pennies on the dollar will raise the $500 million necessary to balance the budget. Increasing the sales tax by one penny on the dollar will raise $250 million, or half of what is needed to balance the budget. It should be noted, however, that a recent statewide public opinion poll showed a clear majority against any tax increase. A sales tax increase fared best.  Still, 60 percent opposed it, only 25 percent supported it, and the remaining 15 percent were undecided.  The only taxing option to be considered in this activity is an increase in the sales tax.",B2
"Apple’s rise to prominence continued. Sales of the new user-friendly Apple II computer drove the company to vast profitability.
As Apple grew in size and complexity president Mike Markkula thought Jobs lacked the discipline and experience to run the company – which now generated billions in revenue a year and was listed in the Fortune 500. Jobs searched for a new CEO. He hired John Sculley, from Pepsi. Jobs thought Sculley could be his ally against the new board. Initially, they complemented each other. Sculley worked to keep the Apple II making money and Jobs developed and marketed new products.
In the run up to the launch of the Apple Macintosh Steve Jobs demonstrated his mastery for public engagement and building hype.
He hired film director Ridley Scott to make Apple’s ‘1984’ advert, and gained huge publicity by pitching Apple as a rebel outsider taking on the computer giant IBM. He secured interviews and features in magazines across America. The launch was masterminded by Jobs, though Apple CEO John Sculley said “he was driving people insane” with his perfectionism. He demonstrated the mouse and graphical interface and the new computer even spoke to the audience. Afterwards, he got a standing ovation.
Steve Jobs was furious when Bill Gates’ Microsoft launched Windows, which used many of the same ideas as the new Macintosh.
The two companies had worked together on software and Microsoft had agreed to launch after Apple, but delays to the Mac caused by Jobs’ attention to detail had allowed Microsoft to catch up. ",B2
"German forces sweep across the country and by December 1941 have almost reached Moscow. Stalin refuses to leave the city, deciding victory must be won at any cost. The Battle of Stalingrad is the turning point of the war. Hitler attacks the city bearing Stalin’s name to humiliate him, but Stalin tells his army ""Not a step backwards"". They suffer over a million casualties but manage to defeat the Nazis in 1943. The Soviet Army begins the long push back into Germany and all the way to Berlin.
Stalin plays a decisive role in Germany’s defeat and great swathes of Eastern Europe are occupied by Soviet forces including East Berlin.
Stalin is adamant these countries will be satellite states of the Soviet Union. His former allies America and Britain now become his rivals and Churchill states that an “iron curtain” is falling over Europe. In a struggle for control of the capital, Stalin blocks entry to allied-occupied West Berlin. The US responds with an 11-month long airlift of supplies to people trapped in that part of the city. On 29 August 1949 the Soviet Union tests its first atomic bomb. The Cold War begins in earnest.
In Stalin’s last years he becomes increasingly suspicious, and continues to conduct purges against his enemies within the Party.
After a night of heavy drinking Stalin dies of a stroke on 5 March 1953. Many in the Soviet Union mourn the loss of this great leader who transformed the Soviet Union from a feudal economy to an industrial power and played a crucial role in defeating Hitler. But the millions incarcerated cheer at the demise of one of the most murderous dictators in history. Stalin’s successor Khrushchev denounces the dead dictator and begins a wave of ""destalinization.""",B2
"Although Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are now Shakespeare's most performed plays, that was not always the case. Thanks to their heady mix of nationalism, soap opera and tabloid scandal, in his own time we think it was probably his history plays that packed playhouses. We now believe Henry IV Pt. 1 was his most reprinted play in his day.
By delving into the past, Shakespeare helped his audiences confront the issues of their time.
In the 16th Century, the Reformation saw England cut adrift from Catholic Europe. Freed from the influence of Rome, the nation now had to define itself on its own terms – so it turned to the past to do it.
There was a renewed appetite for English history. But while scores of chronicles were written for the educated few, most Elizabethans were illiterate. They used other ways to learn their nation’s story.
As they had done for centuries, in Shakespeare's day ordinary people used folk ballads to pass stories from one generation to the next, often mixing legend and myth with historical fact.
Another way of learning about the past was tourism. By the late 1500s, many people were queuing to take a tour of Westminster Abbey, a thriving Elizabethan tourist attraction. Visitors could look around the monuments and tombs of great monarchs, learning about their lives and deeds from tour guides.
But perhaps the most popular way to learn about history was at London’s public theatres, a new form of entertainment for the masses. Thanks to writers like Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, ordinary folk could see England's great monarchs brought to life on the stage. Actors entertained the crowds with a picture of England conjured from great events of the past.",B2
"Castro married Mirtha Diaz Balart de Nunez, a fellow student and the daughter of a prominent Cuban politician.
Mirtha’s family disapproved of Castro’s radical politics, but still paid for his honeymoon in the US. The following year they had a son Fidel Ángel – ‘Fidelito’. Their marriage came under strain because Mirtha’s family had close ties with Fulgencio Batista, the powerful right-wing military general and former president.
Castro was crushed when his mentor Chibás shot himself in the stomach during a radio broadcast in August 1951 and died 11 days later.
Castro started studying the ideas of Karl Marx as he sought a political solution to Cuba’s deep problems. In 1952 he ran as an independent candidate for the Cuban congress. That March his plans for a political career were thwarted when Batista re-seized power in military coup. Seeing scores of his close comrades murdered by the oppressive regime, Castro lost faith in democracy – and was set on a path towards armed revolution.
In 1952 Castro and his younger brother Raúl formed an underground revolutionary organisation and began military training.
The following year, Castro led a rising against Batista. About 140 rebels attacked a federal garrison at Moncada, Santiago. They were outnumbered and forced to retreat. Many of the rebels were executed, but the Castro brothers were imprisoned. When Batista turned Castro’s trial into a media spectacle, Fidel took advantage of the moment to attack the regime in his famous History Will Absolve Me speech. Although he was sentenced to 15 years in prison, his words registered with the Cuban people.",B2
"The environment is a rough one, but a most important obstacle democracy faces is that Americans simply do not appreciate what democracy means in practice. In theory, we all revere democracy and support certain principles that underlie it. But we are uncomfortable with the nitty-gritty workings of democracy. It is unappealing to the average eye. 
First, many Americans do not see why there is so much conflict in politics. Research by political scientists has shown that many Americans think that most people agree on basic issues of public policy. So why is there so much fighting in Congress and state legislatures? To some extent people are correct. At a very general level, Americans are in agreement. They want better schools, better health care, and better highways. But there is disagreement over how to achieve these general goals, how to prioritize expenditures, and whether to raise taxes to pay for them. The more specific the issue becomes, the greater the disagreement. It is said that the devil is in the details, and lawmaking is a detailed business. It is easy to believe that most people agree because we live in relatively homogeneous political communities or deal with people who tend to be politically alike. In the nation at large, however, there is sharp disagreement on issues such as abortion, guns, the death penalty, and gay rights, to name only a few. Still there may be substantial agreement in different communities. For example, a poll in USA TODAY showed that in Montclair, N.J., about 75 percent of residents agreed on a number of major issues and in Franklin, Tenn., about the same proportion agreed. But the residents of Montclair and Franklin agreed in opposite directions. ",B2
"Stalin promotes an image of himself as a great benevolent leader and hero of the Soviet Union.
Yet he is increasingly paranoid and purges the Communist party and Army of anyone who might oppose him. Ninety three of the 139 Central Committee members are killed and 81 of the 103 generals and admirals are executed. The secret police strictly enforce Stalinism and people are encouraged to inform on one another. Three million people are accused of opposing Communism and sent to the gulag, a system of labour camps in Siberia. Around 750,000 people are summarily killed.
In 1919 Stalin marries his second wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva and they have two children – Svetlana and Vassily.
He abuses Nadezhda and she eventually kills herself in 1932. He makes sure her death is officially reported as being caused by appendicitis. Yakov, his son from his first wife, is a soldier in the Red Army and is captured early on in WW2. When the Germans propose to free him in a prisoner swap, Stalin refuses as he believes his son surrendered voluntarily, Yakov dies in a Nazi concentration camp in 1943.
Stalin signs a nonaggression pact with Adolf Hitler and they agree to carve up Eastern Europe between them.
When Hitler’s armies easily defeat France and Britain retreats, Stalin ignores warnings from his generals and is completely unprepared for the Nazi Blitzkrieg attack of June 1941, which tears through Poland and into the Soviet Union. The Soviet Army suffer huge losses. Stalin is incandescent with rage at Hitler's betrayal and retreats to his office unable to make any decisions. Soviet Russia is paralysed for several days as the Nazi war machine rolls on towards Moscow.",B2
"Steve Jobs carried his relentless love of design into all areas of his life, often involving his young family.
He had been married to Laurene Powell Jobs since 1991, with whom he had three children. They remained married until Jobs’ death in 2011. In 1996, Jobs gave an interview to Wired magazine where he described his family’s search for a better washing machine. Jobs said they discussed “design, but also the values of our family” with his two pre-school children. It took two weeks of nightly discussions at the dinner table before they settled on one to buy.
In 1997 Apple, in its 12th consecutive year of financial loss, bought NeXT and asked Steve Jobs to return as interim CEO.
In his first time with Apple in the 70s and 80s he showed he could be a creative visionary, but in his second term with the company, he showed he could lead it. He quickly returned Apple to profitability by terminating projects, firing employees and introducing the 'Think Different' campaign. It was designed to boost the morale of the employees as much as advertise Apple. While interim CEO his annual salary was a mere $1. He said he did not want staff to think he was “coming back to get rich.”
British designer Jonathan Ive had been considering leaving Apple until Jobs’ emphasis on product over profit convinced him to stay.
Their relationship brought together Ive’s creativity and Jobs’ editorial and marketing skills.

"The Queen called 1992 her Annus horribilis ""horrible year"" in a speech made after a series of unpleasant events.
The marriages of two of her children, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew, broke down. A best-selling book was published detailing Princess Diana's unhappiness and collapsing marriage. There was also a large and damaging fire at Windsor Castle, the Queen’s private home. Public support for the Royal Family dipped, though the Queen remained dignified and constant figure.
Princess Diana died in an accident in 1997. Amid the mourning, the Queen faced a critical dilemma.
Initially, the Royal Family grieved privately. However, the public reaction to Diana's death led to accusations the Queen was unresponsive and out of touch with the public mood. A Daily Express headline declared, ‘Show Us You Care.’ That evening, the Queen made a broadcast paying tribute to Diana as an ""exceptional and gifted human being"". The swell of anger had shocked the Queen and she admitted there were ""lessons to be drawn from her life and the extraordinary public reaction to her death"".
Fifty years after her father's death, both the Queen's mother and sister died within two months of each other.
However, popular support for the Queen was increasing after the difficult 1990s. Throughout her reign, the Queen represented continuity and surety, though she accepted the monarchy must attempt to renew itself. She undertook a 40,000-mile tour of the Commonwealth.

"I will now give you a short account of Columbus, who was one of the
greatest men the world ever produced. He was born in the city of Genoa,
in Italy; his family were almost all sailors, and he was brought up to be a sailor also, and after being taught geography and various other things
necessary for a sea captain to know, he was sent on board ship at the
age of fourteen. Columbus was tall, muscular, and of a commanding
aspect; his hair, light in youth, turned prematurely grey, and before he
reached the age of thirty was white as snow.

His first voyages were short ones, but after several years, desiring to
see and learn more of distant countries, and thinking there were still
new ones to be discovered, he went into the service of the King of
Portugal and made many voyages to the western coast of Africa, and to
the Canaries, Madeira and the Azores, islands lying off that
coast, which were then the most westerly lands known to Europeans.

In his visits to these parts, one person informed him that his ship,
sailing out farther to the west than usual, had picked up out of the sea
a piece of wood curiously carved, and that very thick canes, like those
which travellers had found in India, had been seen floating on the
waves; also that great trees, torn up by the roots, had often been cast
on shore, and once two dead bodies of men, with strange features,
neither like Europeans nor Africans, were washed up on the coast of the
Azores.

"The Woolworth Fishing for the Future initiative ensures that a lot of the wild caught species we sell in our stores meets the standards of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) for sustainable fishing. Fishing activities must be well managed to ensure that they do not have a negative effect on marine ecosystems. 
The ocean environment consists of many living and non-living components that all work together to form the marine ecosystem. Living components might be fish, plants or shellfish, while non-living things could be rocks, sandy ocean beds or other structures in the sea. Keeping marine ecosystems in balance keeps fish stocks healthy and helps ensure that there will be fish for the future. It is therefore important to manage fishing activities within ecological limits – this means making sure that we don’t take out too many fish and thereby damage the ecosystem that these fish live in. To find out how many fish we can take out we first need to understand and reduce the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem. By doing this we can make sure that we fish in a way that keeps the ecosystem balanced and allows fish stocks to thrive. 
We all need to work together, from the fishermen through to the people eating fish, to ensure that we fish sustainably. Fishing sustainably means that our generation must not use up all the marine resources our planet holds. We must use resources carefully so that fish species are able to survive and reproduce and everyone can benefit now and in the future. Taking out too many fish and thereby damaging ecosystems is called overfishing and not sustainable. 
All fishing methods have some impact on the environment.

"Victoria's Jubilee bolstered her reputation. Her face was emblazoned on products from mugs to jars of mustard to mark the occasion.

"Second, because they do not see the existence of differences in the public, many Americans do not see the need for conflict in Congress and state legislatures. “We all know what’s right, so why don’t they just do it,” is a dominant attitude. Survey research and focus group studies have demonstrated that people want action and not deliberation, which they regard as “bickering.” They find stalemate unsatisfactory when the two sides cannot get together, yet they regard compromise as “selling out.” Americans, in short, are not in sympathy with the way in which issues are settled in democratic politics. 
Since democracy appreciation does not come naturally, it has to be taught—just as music and art appreciation have to be taught.  This is offered as a first, and a fundamental, lesson in appreciating democracy.  It has three principal objectives: 
To develop in students an understanding of the differences in values, interests, priorities and opinions that exist in a diverse society such as ours. The differences that exist are normal in a democracy and should be respected, not regretted. 
To develop in students familiarity with different methods used in settling conflicts among values, interests, priorities and opinions in our democracy. The methods that are of concern are deliberation, negotiation (including compromise) and decision by voting. 
To develop in students an awareness that differences among people and deliberation, compromise and voting exist not only in contemporary political life. They exist in one’s personal, family, school and work life as well. They also exist in historical events, such as the framing of the U.S. Constitution. There is nothing arcane or mystical about the processes that are the focus of this lesson. Yet, many Americans don’t get it.",B2
"In 1028, an unmarried French woman bore a son to the Duke of Normandy. People taunted the boy with the nickname ‘William the Bastard’. Yet he not only became a formidable Norman ruler: he became one of England's most brutal and influential kings.
From the Battle of Hastings to the Domesday Book, William was responsible for truly extraordinary events in England's history. Find out how a brutal childhood, some lucky breaks and a festering angry grudge shaped the man who changed Britain forever.
On the 28 September 1066, around 7,000 soldiers from Northern France landed on the Sussex coast. Led by William, the Duke of Normandy, they were soon to launch a battle that would become one of the most famous in all of English History – the Battle of Hastings.
The bloody day of fighting on the 14 October proved to be a cataclysmic event in English history: a decisive turning point which transformed England forever.
The legacy of this brutal conquest - the last time England was successfully invaded – pervades many aspects of our language and culture today.
Though many Anglo-Saxons initially resisted their new occupiers, the Norman conquest brought about one of the fastest, most brutal and pervasive transformations in English history.
As the occupation endured the English adopted aspects of Norman culture. 
Before 1066, the common language was Old English. When the French-speaking Normans arrived, the languages mixed, creating the English we know today. This coexistence of French and English explains why the latter has so many words for the same thing.",B2
"The House of Tudor was one of the most successful and lavish royal dynasties in British history. Its crowning years began here, in Pembroke Castle, with the birth of Henry Tudor in January 1457. Harri Tudur as he was affectionately known in Wales, would become the first Tudor king, Henry VII in 1485. And the House of Tudor would go on to produce two of the nation’s most renowned monarchs, Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The Tudor line had humble origins in a place called Penmynydd on the island of Anglesey in north Wales. The Tudurs as they were known were already a well-respected and powerful family. They had served ancient lines of Welsh princes, such as Llywelyn the Great who was the son-in-law of King John of Magna Carta fame. But the family was also related to the outlawed Owain Glyndwr. He opposed the British crown during the Welsh Wars of Independence that raged from 1400 to 1415. As a result, the Tudurs lost much of their land, wealth and titles to the crown. So perhaps it was in order to rebuild their family name that a young Owain Tudur – Henry Tudor’s grandfather – was packed off to London to serve as a page under the King Henry V’s steward, Sir Walter Hungerford.

Agreement or consensus. What degree of agreement is necessary? When does a consensus exist? Although a majority rules, a 51-49 split indicates sharp division, not agreement. We should consider agreement or consensus on an issue to be something like a 65-35 division, or more likely a 50:25 division with another 25 percent without an opinion or position. There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes agreement or consensus, but it is a topic that the class should explore. Even when there is a consensus, some people will still have contrary views. 
Deliberation is a process in which each side tries to convince the other of its own position and ideas, and each side is open to being convinced by the other. This does not mean that everybody on one side is open to persuasion, but, rather, that a healthy number of people are. In deliberation, arguments are made on the merits of the case and how each proposal will advance the public interest in some way. Most of the discussion that takes place in Congress and state legislatures is of a deliberative nature. It revolves around the merits, as seen by various participants in the process. 
Negotiation supplements deliberation as a tool for reaching a settlement. In negotiating, it no longer is a question of persuading the other side on the basis of a substantive argument. Each side is firm in its beliefs, but may be willing to give in to reach a settlement. ",B2
"Queen Victoria restored the reputation of a monarchy tarnished by the extravagance of her royal uncles. She also shaped a new role for the Royal Family, reconnecting it with the public through civic duties.
At just 4ft 11in tall, Victoria was a towering presence as a symbol of her Empire. She and her husband Albert and their nine children came to symbolise a new, confident age.
Alexandrina Victoria was born to the Duchess of Kent. Her father was the fourth son of George III and she was fifth in line to the throne.
However, she had three elderly uncles ahead of her in the succession. So when her father died when she was eight months her prospects of becoming queen were good. The princess, known as Victoria, was raised at Kensington Palace. She was educated by her governess Baroness Lehzen, who taught her languages, arithmetic, drawing and music. Her widowed mother was lonely and depended utterly on John Conroy – a servant of her former husband who was bent on power.
After the death of two uncles, the teenage Victoria became heir to her final surviving uncle King William IV.
But Victoria's youth was dominated by strict rules known as the 'Kensington System'. These rules included sharing a room with her mother and having no time alone. The system was designed by John Conroy, who hoped to manipulate her to gain further power and influence. When Victoria was 13 she was taken on a tour of the Midlands so that Conroy and her mother could show her off to the public. The princess found it exhausting and became increasingly stubborn. She started writing a diary.",B2
"As the tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain intensified, delegates gathered in 1775 at the Second Continental Congress to discuss how best to proceed.  By the late spring of 1776, independence from Great Britain seemed imminent.  The next serious issue the delegates faced was how to govern the new nation.  On July 2, 1776, a plan was submitted to the Congress that called for a confederation of states to be formed around a weak central government. This system was adopted and became known as the Articles of Confederation.  Under the Articles of Confederation, the young nation successfully fought a war against Great Britain and secured its independence. However, the structure of the new government led to many problems for the country. Under the Articles of Confederation the states retained more power than the national government.  Although this was done intentionally to avoid a central government that could become too powerful and tyrannical, the result was chaos that threatened the very existence of the new nation.  Some of the problems were the national government’s inability to enforce any laws or treaties that it passed or to collect taxes from the states.  It was left to the states to enforce the laws and to contribute financially to the central government through the levying of state taxes.  Due to this system, the central government was unable to repay war debts and raise sufficient funds to successfully operate. In addition, many treaties negotiated with foreign nations were not enforced by the states, thus jeopardizing the nation’s credibility in the international arena.  There was also a general lack of cooperation among states, particularly concerning trade.  Once again, the national government was powerless to take any action because each state maintained individual sovereignty.",B2
"There are many possibilities in negotiating, but the main ingredient is a compromise of one sort or another. In a compromise, each side gives up some of what it wants in order to get something. For example, Participant A is willing to delete a provision from a bill to which Participant B objects, but only if B is willing to delete a provision to which A objects. That is a compromise. A budgetary example is probably the easiest to understand. If the bill passed by the senate has an appropriation of $50 million for an automobile inspection system, but the bill passed by the house appropriates only $30 million for that purpose, the natural compromise position would be $40 million. In the legislative process individuals compromise, legislative parties compromise, the senate and the house compromise, and the legislature and the executive compromise.
A decision must be reached for a settlement to be achieved. In our system of representative democracy, majority rule is an overarching principle. Although majorities rule, another overarching principle is that minorities’ rights must be protected. The tension between majority rule and minority rights is evident in legislative bodies. Here, decisions as to a settlement are decided by a majority vote, but a minority has a say in the process. A majority of those voting, or those authorized to vote, must concur for a bill to be passed. In some instances an extraordinary majority is required. That is the case in the U.S. Senate, where a three-fifths vote is necessary to bring debate to an end or to stop a filibuster. ",B2
"Following the death of his beloved Queen Catherine, Owen was charged with violating laws concerning his marriage to the late queen. Having been acquitted of all the trumped up charges he was released and headed home to Wales. However he wasn’t to escape that easily and he was arrested again and this time sent to the notorious Newgate Prison in London. Escaping once, he was recaptured and taken to Windsor Castle. Fortunately for him, his step-son now of age to rule, intervened. He was bailed and subsequently pardoned by King VI and moved into the royal household. There he received a generous pension and was given lands and titles such as Warden of Forestries, and Deputy Lord Lieutenant. Sadly the witty and charismatic Welshman didn’t live to see a Tudor heir on the English throne. At the age of 61 his life came to an abrupt end during the Wars of the Roses. After taking part in a heavy Lancastrian defeat at Mortimer’s Cross in 1461, the ageing soldier was captured and believed he would be spared due to his connections to the royal family. However it wasn’t to be and Owen was executed. The Yorkists would eventually win the War of the Roses with Henry VI fleeing and Edward IV being crowned king. It wasn’t until 1483 when Richard III usurped the throne that Henry, who’d been in exile for 14 years, finally saw his chance to avenge his grandfather’s death. ",B2
"The pressure, however, is coming mainly from the opposition to raising the tax on cigarettes—tobacco companies, represented by their organization, the Tobacco Institute, and a number of individual constituents who smoke. Neither smoking nor non-smoking constituents are very organized on the issue. However, a few national health organizations have taken positions in support of a measure that might discourage smoking. 
At this point, neither party has taken a stand for or against. However, if most of its members take one side or the other, members of the majority party will probably take a position when they meet together. 
What appears decisive are the legislator’s convictions and record on the issue. This particular legislator has an anti-tobacco record, although he/she would not go so far as to try to outlaw cigarettes. The campaign contribution from the Tobacco Institute makes little difference when it runs counter to a legislator’s beliefs, as it does in this case. Conscience nearly always outweighs contribution.
Most legislators would support this increase in the tax on tobacco, if the facts line up as they do in this scenario. 
If, however, half the legislator’s constituency and a majority of the legislator’s supporters were strongly opposed to the tax, then the legislator’s conviction would be challenged by the constituency. Under these circumstances, the decision could go either way. In the example presented here, that is not the case.",B2
"It was unheard of for a defence barrister to put his client into the witness box until one brilliant counsel took a daring gamble in December 1907.
Defendants had enjoyed the legal right to give evidence on oath since 1898, but it was considered ill-advised or reckless to let them do so. With his client Robert Wood facing a death sentence if convicted of the grisly murder of Camden Town prostitute Emily Dimmock, Edward Marshall Hall KC decided to fly in the face of convention. Wood, an artist, charmed the jury from the stand and was duly acquitted. Many more defendants would follow him into the dock, if not always with the same success.
The first female jurors were sworn in at Bristol Quarter Sessions on 29 July 1920, where they heard evidence in the case against William Henry Ayton, 52, who was accused of stealing parcels at Weston-super-Mare station. In 1949 Rose Heilbron and Helena Normanton became the UK's first female barristers, and in 1972 Dame Rose went on to become the first female judge to sit at the Old Bailey.
When Reginald Woolmington sawed the barrel off his shotgun and killed his wife in November 1934, he had no idea it would end up shaping legal history.
At his trial the following year the 21-year-old Dorset farm labourer claimed the gun had gone off by mistake and he'd had no intention of hurting her. When the judge ruled that it fell on the defendant to prove the shooting was accidental, the jury found Woolmington guilty and he was sentenced to death. Three days before he was due to hang, the House of Lords ruled that defendants should be considered innocent until proven guilty, and Woolmington walked free.",B2
"Our right to a fair trial, which underpins criminal law in the United Kingdom, the USA and many other nations, can be traced back to Magna Carta in 1215.
The Great Charter defined a person's right not to be imprisoned 'but by the lawful judgment of his peers'. Down the years our legal rights have continued to evolve, and some remarkable events have helped shape the law as it stands today
Before Magna Carta a barbaric system of justice held sway in Britain and across much of Europe.
Between the ninth and 13th centuries a person's guilt or innocence was determined by trial by fire or water. Suspects were burnt with hot metal, or else bound and thrown into a pool, and it was left to God to spare the innocent. Though discredited now, trial by ordeal was considered highly effective in this superstitious era as most guilty criminals preferred to confess and so avoid trial. The practice, overseen by the church, was banned by Pope Innocent III in 1215.
Until the mid-17th Century someone accused of a crime could find themselves facing another terrifying ordeal: torture.
In the century after 1540, 81 torture warrants were issued in England. To extract information, criminal suspects were suspended from manacles or stretched on the notorious rack. Things changed after the trial of John Archer in May 1640. Accused of high treason after his arrest during a riot, Archer, a glove-maker, was tortured on the rack. But his torturers learned nothing and his was the last recorded warrant for judicial torture.",B2
"The dominating factor here are the constituents, who are against having their taxes raised—at least the income, sales, or local property taxes. There are very few issues about which people in a legislator’s district are concerned. According to a recent survey of legislators in five states (Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Vermont and Washington), their constituents had an opinion on about 5 percent of the hundreds of bills on which legislators had to vote in a session. Moreover, during the course of a two-year legislative session, the number of bills on which the constituency had a clear position—with a substantial majority for or against—did not normally exceed 10 and usually was five or fewer.The overwhelming number of issues with which legislators deal, therefore, do not register with constituents. Many issues are too narrow or too technical, and only a handful affect the interests of a sizeable number of people in the district. So, when an issue does register, legislators pay careful attention. 
Few constituency mandates, “directing” the legislator to act in one manner or another, exist. One that currently does, however—at least in most places—is “Don’t raise my taxes.” This mandate applies to both income and sales taxes, but not necessarily to business taxes or taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Few legislators want to contradict a large number of their constituents. It is not “good politics” and, if the issue is important enough (as are taxes) to their constituents, to vote for higher taxes is to risk defeat at the next election.",B2
"‘Does Magna Carta mean nothing to you? Did she die in vain?’ — so joked comedian Tony Hancock (1924-68) in Hancock’s Half Hour back in the 1950s. A light-hearted query, of course, but as we ready ourselves for Magna Carta’s 800th anniversary celebrations in June 2015 it is worth revisiting how relevant the ‘Great Charter’ still is.
On the one hand, for many, Magna Carta is alive and well. It remains a bedrock of Britishness; the foundation of all that’s good about laws and liberties from Land’s End to John O’Groats. The alternative view is that Magna Carta has been reduced to nothing but a symbol; a crumbling relic, redundant at law and in practice.
As always, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
There’s rather more nuance to the document than you might think. The 1215 original, which didn’t even bear the famous title at first, was swiftly scrapped by the Pope, as it had been dragged from ‘Bad King John’ under duress. Its beneficiaries were not oppressed serfs (who largely remained in slavery) but Anglo-Norman barons (themselves responsible for much of the oppressing) desperate to curb the monarch’s excesses. And Magna Carta embodied neither jury trial nor habeas corpus — both came later and over time. In reality, much of its text was pretty obscure and administrative — and, frankly, rather dull.
That said, clauses 39 and 40 — and their talk of free men, lawful judgment and justice — retain ‘the power to make the blood race’, to echo Lord Bingham (1933-2010). In the United States of America, Magna Carta informed both the Declaration of Independence and Constitution and is held in almost legendary esteem. However, its authority and influence may derive more from what people think it said, rather than that which it actually contained.",B2
"Magna Carta, meaning ‘The Great Charter’, is one of the most famous documents in the world. Originally issued by King John of England (r.1199-1216) as a practical solution to the political crisis he faced in 1215, Magna Carta established for the first time the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law. Although nearly a third of the text was deleted or substantially rewritten within ten years, and almost all the clauses have been repealed in modern times, Magna Carta remains a cornerstone of the British constitution. Most of the 63 clauses granted by King John dealt with specific grievances relating to his rule. However, buried within them were a number of fundamental values that both challenged the autocracy of the king and proved highly adaptable in future centuries. Most famously, the 39th clause gave all ‘free men’ the right to justice and a fair trial. Some of Magna Carta’s core principles are echoed in the United States Bill of Rights (1791) and in many other constitutional documents around the world, as well as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the European Convention on Human Rights (1950).
In 1215 Magna Carta was a peace treaty between the King and the rebel barons. In that respect it was a failure, but it provided a new framework for the relationship between the King and his subjects. The 1225 version of Magna Carta, freely issued by Henry III (r.1216-72) in return for a tax granted to him by the whole kingdom, took this idea further and became the definitive version of the text. Three clauses of the 1225 Magna Carta remain on the statute book today.",B2
"The five scenarios have been scripted with particular lessons on representation in mind.  These scenarios are examined, from the point of view of political science research, to show the kinds of issues legislators face and some of the key factors that influence their decisions. Certainly not every legislator, if faced with these issues and considerations, would decide in the same way and with a similar weighting to the factors involved. Our contention is that most legislators would behave as suggested below.
Scenario 1. Deciding on an Increase in the Sales Tax 
This would be a relatively easy decision for most legislators. Given the facts stipulated in the scenario, most legislators would probably oppose legislation increasing the sales tax, even by 2 cents. 
The merits of the case for an increase are simply not strong enough, even for those who are advocates for public education in the state. Despite increased funding for education in the past, local property taxes have been rising. Many legislators would not be confident in the ability or will of local elected officials to hold down expenditures. 
Most of the organized group activity supports the sales tax increase. The so-called “special interests” are mainly on one side. The teachers’ association is an especially important group because it has a relatively large membership statewide and teachers live and work in the district of every legislator in the state. Despite the strong organization, skillful lobbyists and the grassroots advocacy of its members, the teachers’ association is not likely to prevail on an issue such as this one.",B2
"Our governmental system at both the national and state levels is based on the principle of representation. People do not themselves govern, nor do they ordinarily vote to adopt laws and public policy. Rather, they govern indirectly by electing legislators to represent them. 
For the framers of the U.S. Constitution, the legitimacy of the government came from the consent of the governed. The House of Representatives, with its members elected by specific geographical areas throughout the nation, was designed to reflect the views of the people. The Senate, with its members originally selected by state legislatures, was designed to reflect the sovereignty of the states. The will of the people would find its way through legislative chambers by means of lawmakers who would assess the preferences and interests of the people they represent and take them into account in deciding on matters of public policy. Legislators would lead, interpret and reflect public opinion as they assembled in Congress. 
Today, members of both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate and the houses and senates of the 50 states (except Nebraska, which is unicameral and has a senate, but not a house) are elected by the people and are considered to be representatives of the people. 
At the state level, for example, legislators represent their constituents in a number of ways. They help people in their district who may have problems with governmental regulations or service provision such as welfare benefits, unemployment compensation, driver’s licenses, insurance costs, taxes—almost anything under the sun. They try to secure funds for projects— such as the construction of a court house or funding for travel by a high school band—for their districts.",B2
"Interest groups also provide a channel for representation, although few people recognize this. Indeed, most Americans think that interest groups (or “special interests” as they are pejoratively termed) have too much power and do more harm than good. 
If, as the public believes, interest groups are the enemy, then, in the words of the comic-strip character Pogo, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” That is because seven of 10 Americans belong to one interest group or another, and four of 10 belong to more than one group. Of course, the political and policy opinions and interests of all citizens are represented by groups to which we do not belong but with whom we share values or interests.  It may well be that (as the case of their attitude toward their own representative in comparison with their attitude toward everyone else’s representative) people think the group to which they belong is pursuing, not a “special” interest, but rather the public interest, while groups whose interest they do not share are self-serving. 
The concerns of the constituency, political parties and interest groups come to bear on the lawmaking process. So also do other factors, the most important of which are the merits of the particular case, that is, the substantive arguments for and against a particular bill, what individual representatives themselves believe, and their past records.
Most of the discussion that takes place in the legislative process—whether in committee or on the floor or by lobbyists for various groups—relates to the merits of proposed legislation.",B2
"Objectives 
An appreciation of representation does not come easily. It must be taught, just as music and art appreciation and the appreciation of democracy in practice are. This teaching lesson on how lawmakers decide has the following objectives:
To show students the channels by which people’s values, interests and priorities are expressed in the legislative process. The principal channels of representation considered here are: first, those elected to legislative office; second, the two major political parties; and third, the interest groups that advocate and lobby for (and against) a particular policy. 
To bring to the attention of students the major factors that affect how legislators reach their decisions on matters of public policy. These factors are a) the merits of the case; b) the views of constituents; c) the role of interest groups; d) the position of the political party; and e) the conviction and record of the individual legislator. 
To give students an idea of how legislators make up their minds on issues of public policy and the variation in decision making, depending upon the specific issue being examined. 
To illustrate, albeit in a simplified way, the multiple considerations that operate in lawmaking in the states. 
This lesson is designed to promote learning in high school government, civics or history courses that is in accord with standards that are in effect in virtually every state. It also is designed to: 
Increase a student’s knowledge about channels of representation; the roles of constituency, political parties and interest groups; the kinds of issues that arise; and legislator decision making in representative democracy. 
Develop a student’s skills in reasoning through the decision-making process of legislators, who are being influenced by a number of major factors.",B2
"'Spiral Island II' feels like an island and certainly looks like one with its beaches, mangroves, palm trees, two ponds and waterfall. But unlike most tropical islands, underneath it there are thousands of plastic bottles to keep it afloat.
All of this is the work of one man, Rishi (Richart) Sowa, artist, musician, carpenter and idealist. In 1998, Rishi gave up his job and left the UK to live a much simpler life in Mexico.
He did not have enough money to buy land so, because he is a practical person, he decided to build his own island which he called 'Spiral Island'. He collected 250,000 empty plastic bottles, put them into nets and built a wooden structure on top of them. On it, he built a small house and collected soil to plant trees and bushes in.
Rishi lived happily on the island with his dog, Rainbow, cats, Bonita and Easy, two chickens and a duck until 2005 when Hurricane Emily washed his island onto the beach and destroyed his home. However, Rishi did not give up and immediately started another island in a slightly more protected part of the coast.
Spiral Island II is a bit smaller than the first island but is even more comfortable and Rishi's two-storey house has wind and solar power. It also has a compost toilet, a solar-powered oven, a wave-powered washing machine and a solar-powered waterfall plus a fountain. Rishi's island is almost self-sufficient;
he keeps chickens and so always has a supply of fresh eggs and he grows coconuts, lemons, bananas, tomatoes and almonds.

"Twenty minutes later, one of Amin's wives greeted me at the door of an ordinary-looking house in Prince Charles Drive. 'I am sorry, Doctor,' she said. 'The President has gone away
on urgent government business. My name is Kay. I am the boy's mother.'
I followed her inside the house. The living room floor was covered with plastic toys. Children ran around shouting and crying. There was a smell of cooking from the kitchen, and everything seemed very ordinary. 
Upstairs, in a bedroom, a ten-year-old boy was lying in bed. He was in pain, and blood was coming out of his nose. 'Is it bad, Doctor?' asked his mother nervously. I shone a small light up the boy's nose. 'Oh, no,' I smiled. 'Nothing serious. He's pushed something up there.'
Kay Amin held the boy down while I slowly and carefully pulled something small and hard out of his nose. I cleaned it and held it up to the light. It was a small plastic toy soldier. 'Campbell,' she said angrily to her son. 'You're a very bad boy.'
I cleaned the boy's nose. 'He'll be fine,' I said. Kay Amin walked me to the door. 'Thank you very much, Doctor,' she said. 'The President will be very pleased.'
The following week, I found a Toyota outside my bungalow. There was an envelope on the driver's seat and, inside it, there was a message from Wasswa on government paper: 'The President is very grateful to you for making his son better,' the Health Minister wrote. 'He has given you this car

"1 More and more state schools in the USA are changing back to single-sex education. According to some American experts, male and female brains are not the same, boys and girls develop at a different rate and they learn differently. Other experts disagree; according to them, there are more learning differences between individuals than between the two genders and girls and boys learn better together. They say there is no evidence that single-sex schools improve academic performance either.
2 I went to a mixed school until last year when I moved to an all girls' school. In my previous school, the boys talked all the time and there were lots of discipline problems in class. There were a lot of stereotypes, appearance was really important and was linked to the girls' popularity. There were only two girls in the ICT classes so I didn't do that as an option. Now, at my new school, classes are quieter and we can talk about things more openly. I feel more relaxed in class, too - I'm not worried about what the boys think about me. This year I'm doing ICT and I'm in the school football team, too!
3 I'm at a mixed school and I'm against single-sex classes. I think that it's not your gender that's important but your personality. I think it's important to have friendships with both boys and girls. For example , I have more in common with two or three girls I know than with lots of boys. I think male single-sex schools are dull, too because they are obsessed with sports such as football, cricket and rugby and I'd hate that!

"The first, simple two-dimensional avatars appeared in the mid-1980s in role-playing computer games. By the late 1990s, they were in web chats like Instant Messenger. 
Nowadays, avatars are everywhere. In most chats, people use simple, ready-made images or upload their own images but you can also use dynamic avatars that move around and talk when you type in your message. Avatars in online worlds like Second Life can talk, walk and fly around, meet people, go shopping or go to classes. There is lots of room for creativity and you can get a brand-new identity. If you're well-off, you can spend a fortune on buying virtual clothes and jewellery for your well-dressed, fashion-conscious avatar. 
Of course, the avatar you choose says a lot about your personality. If your blog avatar is a picture of a kitten, your message is 'I'm a playful, laid-back person.' Well-known cartoon characters or laughing chimpanzees say 'I'm a really funny person.' 
Surprisingly, most people create avatars that look more or less like them and behave like them. However, nearly all avatars are tall, young and nice-looking so people obviously make a few improvements to their bodies and they also experiment with things like long hair, tattoos and piercings. Many people have more than one avatar, a sensible one for work, a good-looking, easy-going one for meeting people and a silly one for having fun. 
Soon, over eighty percent of internet users will have at least one avatar and in some countries there will be more avatars than real people.

I fell to my knees. Then all of a sudden I realised the whole team was
around me - that was a special moment.

Was it all a little crazy afterwards?
The atmosphere on the streets of South Africa was just incredible .
For the first time, all the people had come together and all races and
religions were hugging each other. It was just wonderful.

And getting the trophy from Nelson Mandela was something special?
Nelson Mandela said, 'Thank you very much for what you've done
for South Africa.' but I said, 'Thank you for what you've done.' I
almost felt like hugging him but it wasn't appropriate, I guess. Then I
lifted the trophy. It was unbelievable - I can't describe the feeling.

"1 Luke looks like a typical eighteen-year-old. He is tall
(1.95 metres), skinny and pale and is into strange hats and
loud music. Luke speaks softly and is quite shy but when
he talks about food, you can hear his passion for cooking:
'My life is about food - shopping, preparing, developing and
serving.'
2 Luke Hayes-Alexander is executive chef of Luke's in
Kingston, Canada, started by his parents in 1993 and named
after their eighteen-month-old son. Luke's now attracts food
lovers from all over the world because of the exciting new
dishes created by its brilliant young chef.
3 Luke did not have a typical childhood. When he was a
kid, he did not play video games or watch TV and he hated
sport. He read War and Peace when he was seven (and
understood it!) and he preferred cookbooks to comic books.
After finding out that he had diabetes, he had to know
about all of the ingredients in the food he ate. Soon, he
started helping his father in the kitchen and thinking about
new recipes.
4 At the age of fourteen, Luke left school and, with his
parents' help, combined home schooling with learning more
about food. Then, when Luke was only sixteen, he took the
position of chef from his father and started changing the
small family restaurant into a centre of creative cuisine.
5 Luke loves looking for new and unusual combinations
of flavours and textures for his dishes. Luke cares a lot
about his ingredients; they all come from local farms and
everything in the restaurant is home-made. 'I enjoy cooking
almost everything,' he says, 'if it is beautiful and fresh.'

"FURNITURE TESTER
Jane, how long have you been a furniture tester?
I started last year, when I lost my last job.
What do you do?
Everybody asks me if I sit on the sofa all day but in fact I work really hard - I have to sit on hundreds of chairs, move them, lean back and forward and assess the level of comfort.
Are you tired at the end of the day?
Oh, yes. I often feel like I've run a marathon.
Are you enjoying the job?
I think I'll leave as soon as I find something more interesting. It's pretty boring to sit on chairs all day, you see. 

SNAKE MILKER
Ross, you are a snake milker. Is your job dangerous?
Well, the snakes I deal with are extremely poisonous. So if you don't know enough about snakes or if you lose concentration, you can be bitten and even die.
How do you get the venom out of a snake?
You hold the snake by the head and press the venom glands behind the snake's eyes. The venom is then taken to a laboratory and used to produce anti-venom.
Have you ever been bitten by a snake?
Yes, once, but I got the anti-venom at once so I was just a bit unwell for a few days.
Are you planning to do this for the rest of your life?
Yes, this is a great job! And it's well-paid, too - snake venom can cost a few thousand pounds per gram!

"The West End musical We Will Rock You has been running for over eight years despite not getting any good reviews from the critics. The script was written by Ben Elton to include most of the hit songs of the 1980s British band, Queen, and their celebrity singer, Freddie Mercury, who died in 1991. It was produced by Robert de Niro with the musical direction of Brian May and Roger Taylor, who are still members of Queen.
The story is set in 2032 on Planet Mall where the big corporation, Global Soft, controls the world's music industry. It has banned all musical instruments and people can only listen to computer-generated songs by girl and boy bands. However, young Galileo and his girlfriend, Scaramouche, try to keep alive the legend of rock music and to fight against Global Soft and its evil leader, the Killer Queen.
Although the plot is weak in places, it does not matter because it links together all of the songs and
there is some great comedy. There are some excellent special effects with lasers and huge digital TV screens although some of the choreography and dancing could be better. Despite having a strong voice and sounding like the great Freddie Mercury himself, the lead actor playing Galileo is sometimes uncomfortable on stage, unlike other members of the cast such as the funny Scaramouche or the brilliant Killer Queen.
However, the best thing of all is the music and even if you have never heard Queen before, you will love listening to their greatest hits like Under Pressure and We Are the Champions. That explains why over ten million people around the world have been to see the show despite the opinions of the theatre critics.

"In 2005, Polish archaeologists found a skull and an incomplete
skeleton in the cathedral in Frombork, where Copernicus was buried on
24 May 1543.
The skull was used for identification and forensic experts found that it had belonged to a 70-year-old
man, with a broken nose and a cut above the left eye. Copernicus died at seventy, had a broken nose as a result of a childhood accident and in a self-portrait painted himself with a scar above the left eye. Experts were able to reconstruct the man's face and it matched Copernicus's contemporary portraits.
However, they had to perform DNA tests to confirm the identity of the skull's owner. They couldn't easily find genetic material from Copernicus's close relatives but they were able to find a book he had owned for decades, at Uppsala University. 
They didn't have to look long to find nine hairs within the pages, some with good DNA samples. The DNA from the hair was the same as from the bones found at Frombork cathedral. Interestingly, the analysis revealed that Copernicus probably had blue eyes, although he usually has dark eyes in his portraits.
Some scientists say the team should not have announced their findings so early - they should have looked more carefully for the DNA from Copernicus's mother or her relatives to check the results, as it is the mother's DNA that is passed on intact from mother to child.
Despite these controversies, the great astronomer was officially buried again on 22 May 2010 in Frombork cathedral. The search for his mother's DNA still continues.

"Looking after the countryside 

THE NATIONAL TRUST 

The National Trust is an organisation whose aim is to conserve the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to one of the wardens employed by the Trust to look after the beautiful areas it owns. 

Common sense. That's what a National Trust Warden needs, according to Gareth Roberts. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're continually dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists and building firms.' 
Gareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he married. About 80 people applied for the post as National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience won him the job, despite his lack of formal training. 
'I find it particularly helpful that I still farm with my parents and that I can deal with farmers on the same level and be aware of their problems. Also, they can't take me in about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he is well able to cope with the physical demands of the job - erecting fences, planting trees, building walls. 
Since he has been with the Trust, Gareth says he has come to understand more about nature conservation. 'When I was a youngster,' he recalls, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae and old birds' nests. And I thought to myself recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's really become clear to me that farming has affected the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' 
Gareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were set against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way.Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at the crossroads and there's just a small step needed to join them together,' says Gareth. 
Conservation is one of the main aspects of Gareth's work, along with public entry to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects completed, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills and so on.' 
Gareth is certainly keen on his job and despite never being off duty, he obviously enjoys every minute of his work, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just walk into the area, demand everything, then walk out again as if it's their absolute right. Having to be nice to those people gets on my nerves!' 
But as Gareth says, it's all down to common sense really.So if you've got plenty of that, and you like the idea of an outdoor job, you might think of applying to become a warden like Gareth - but don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a good many years! ",B2
"A NEW LIFE

The Farmer
Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm.
'After 14 years in business, I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. But I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years when I was made redundant. It came out of the blue. I didn't get a particularly good pay-off but it was enough to set up the farm with. My break came when I got to know the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. Through supplying them, my reputation spread and now I also supply meat through mail order. I'm glad
I'm no longer stuck in the office but it's astonishing how little things have changed for me: the same 80- to 90-hour week and still selling a product.'
The Painter
Ron Able white was a manager in advertising but now makes a living as an artist.
'My painting began as a hobby but I realised I was getting far more excitement out of it than out of working. The decision to take redundancy and to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I talked to was very helpful. I think I was the first person who had ever told him, ""I don't want to go back to where I've been."" He was astonished because the majority of people in their mid-forties need to get back to work immediately- they need the money. But we had married young and our children didn't need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We went to the north of England, where we didn't know a soul. It meant leaving all our friends, but we've been lucky in that our friendships have survived the distance - plenty of them come up and visit us now.'
The Haymaker
After working for five years asa company lawyer, Katherine Goodison set up her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients.
'My job as a lawyer was fun. It was stimulating and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were terrible. I realised I didn't want to become a senior partner in the company, working more and more hours, so I left. A lot of people said I'd get bored, but that has never happened. The secret is to have deadlines. Since it's a fashion-related business,you have the collections, next year's shapes,the season-there's always too much to do, so you have to run a very regimented diary. I feel happier now, and definitely less stressed. There are things I really long for, though, like the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I'm totally responsible for the product. If I do a rubbish job, then I'm the one who takes the blame. Of course, you care when you're working for a company, but when your name is all over the promotional material, you care that little bit more.'
The Masseur
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London.
'I had been in financial markets from the age of 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but I never found the work rewarding. I was nearly made redundant in 1989, but I escaped by resigning and travelling for a year. I spent that year trying to work out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the world's best gymnasiums and talked to the owners about how they started up. I knew that to change career I had to get qualifications so I did various courses in massage.Then I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I never used to feel in control, but now I have peace of mind and control of my destiny. That's best of all.'",B2
"Visit to Malaysia
 Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival, and spends a nervous night in the forest. 

Adnan Ali smiled broadly as I presented him with his torn kite. 'You have to keep it,' he said, 'it's traditional - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and anyway, I've plenty more.' He indicated a pile of intricately decorated kites at his feet. All were precisely 120cm wide and long, and made of tissue paper and split bamboo. 
We sat down next to them in the shade of the whispering coniferous trees that are behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in the state of Kelantan, and looked out over Malaysia's biggest and most serious kite festival.
In the centre of the beach stood 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a row of tense competitors holding the lines of their kites waited for the countdown. On the blast of the whistle, the crowd roared and the kites rose into the air like rockets. 
More than 500 men and boys had registered for the competition, which runs for five days every year. Each had entered four different designs which were to be judged on decoration, stability in the air and flying efficiency. 
'Flying kites isn't so difficult,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' The invitation was one of five I'd received that day, and I decided to accept. 
Back in his house I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As dusk fell, he told me to come again the next day to start rebuilding his kite but my plans didn't allow it. 
Instead I explored the southern half of the state, pointing my car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur, into granite mountains dripping with luxuriant rainforest. I took a wrong turning and the smooth road ended suddenly at a river. 
A needle-shaped boat was waiting to ferry pedestrians across. Near it, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.'  Before setting off, it would have been useful to know that nearly all of this distance was uphill, steep and slippery. When I got to the track, however, I found a chap waiting with a flask of tea. 
This was Baba, who looked after a tented kitchen and a dozen or so bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, determined not to think twice about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 
Night was totally black, full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby and thousands of living things moved and squeaked. In the morning there was a tremendous view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon it rained. 
First wind, then lightning lashed the treetops. Seconds later I was wet through. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the scores of giant butterflies avoided the enormous drops. 
Other thoughts included the possibility of my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the likelihood of drowning if I opened my mouth. Fortunately the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 
No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone fired questions at me: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' 
But in the asking there was nothing but friendliness. Kelantan might be best known for its kites but I remember it more for its human kindness. ",B2
"Style Merchants

Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion.
Ned Ingham: Dress Designer
Ned Ingham makes dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional, rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles,' he explains. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes. But you do not have to be a bride to own an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses, given a fresh touch by up-to-the-minute colours and fabrics. For the less adventurous, Ingham's designs include a classic summer navy-blue suit, the centrepiece of the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century. But in his hands, it looks as new as tomorrow.
Sally Quail: Jeweller
Although she once worked for an art dealer, Sally Quail has had no formal training in jewellery. It was only when she could not find an engagement ring she liked that she decided to design her own. The resulting enquiries encouraged her to set up as a designer in 1990. Now her pieces are sought out by many stars of stage and screen. Her signature style is large semi-precious stones set in gold to make magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings fashioned after those worn in the 18th century. However, she has recently begun to use the most precious stone of all - diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36- year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond and that is when I began working with them.'
Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer
Just four years after setting up in the fiercely competitive fashion business, Lily Grimson, with only an introductory course in art and design behind her, has had two of her creations selected for a major design exhibition. Whatever the shape and form of her designs, they are never ignored. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK.
The Grimson handbag is not simply a container - the bags are full of glamour, whether fashioned from the finest calfskin or the heaviest silk. A combination of chic and care makes a Grimson bag something special.
Peter Little: Hairdresser
For over 20 years, Peter Little has taken his scissors to some of the world's top heads. Everyone who is anyone has had their hair styled by this man. 'Most women want real-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. So his approach is a novel one - to ensure that his clients never appear as if they have just walked out of a salon. But this carefree attitude and casual look does not come cheap - £250 for the first appointment, and there's a three-month waiting list. Trading on his celebrity, Peter has produced his own range of hairdryers and other styling equipment. Now, those who can't make it to his salon can create their own styles back at home.
Penny Pratt: Florist
In addition to running her tiny shop, Penny Pratt is a flower consultant for a large chain of supermarkets and provides floral ideas to a number of top restaurants. All of this is good going for someone who has no floristry qualifications and gave up her job as a teacher 10 years ago in order to do 'something different'. And her simple, yet incredibly modern, creations have begun to capture every design prize in the flower business, which has helped her in setting up her own London Flower School. She has recently combined her skills on extremely successful lecture trips to Japan and the USA. She says, ‘Flower arrangements are much simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong and don’t have too many leaves - they are too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, whatever your arrangements, the golden rule remains: the flowers must be of the same species.’

"HAPPY HUNTING GROUND 

We're 'animal people' who enjoy the company of all kinds of creatures. Consider this typical chain of events, leading to total confusion, which began one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at work with the news that she had found a wonderful pine snake. 
'Can we keep him?' she cried. I said 'Yes, but only overnight.' We had set up a special tank for just such passers-through, overnight being long enough to admire and look them up in our well-used natural history book. 
I was late getting home. I hurriedly put a pot on to boil just as screams of 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' came from my sons' bedroom. I leapt to it. 
The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day present. (I've [line 23: beginning] heard that some mothers get [line 23: end] perfume.) Domino, with mouse feet waving from his jaws, ran round and round the bedroom that was crowded with furniture and children. 
Looking for a way out so he could enjoy his catch, Domino had so far avoided the forest of waving arms. I threw myself into the confusion and promptly tripped over something or someone to find myself on the floor. 
As I thought about dropping my full weight on Domino when he next came past, my eyes locked on the snake. It had escaped - or, more correctly, was escaping. It was pouring itself up and out and off the table and all over the floor. I crouched like a rabbit at the approach of its bullish head, and long powerful body. 
The snake and I were now both being jumped over by cat/mouse/kids in a screaming, leaping, hissing mass - the snake striking at every moment, the dog barking wildly. 
The pot boiled over in the kitchen and I raced to shut off the gas, returning to the battle with new strength. This time I successfully captured Domino by the tail, and pulled the small, damp and miraculously uninjured mouse from his growling jaws. Incidentally, the same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times during its lifetime, but eventually died of old age. 
[line 60: beginning] Encouraged by my success with the [line 60: end] cat, I looked the snake over for weak points. It didn't have any. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking backwards and forwards, but without a flute. Gradually the snake relaxed enough to drop its head on to its piled-up body, but its eyes still shone with suspicion. I eventually ever-so-slowly eased my hands beneath the piled-up snake and gradually raised myself to a kneeling position, then I stood up and walked to the very end of the garden where I gave the snake the choice of living happily ever after on the garden shed by pointing it in the direction of a handy tree. 
But when I finally gathered enough courage to release the snake's head - fully expecting it to swing instantly around to crush my face in its powerful jaws - it slid away from the tree and up over my shoulders where, like a colourful leathery shawl, it gave every sign of making itself comfortable for the winter. 
We stood in the gathering dusk, four young children, Mum and the snake. DJ, my eldest, broke the heavy silence with a scientific explanation: 'You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and fat and warm, and the shed isn't.' I had the children gather at the snake's tail end and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly and unwillingly it did so. Without a backward glance, the snake travelled smoothly up the wall to disappear over the now night-shadowed roof. 
As the last tiny bit of tail disappeared from our property, three-year old Clay sighed and said it for all of us: 'Boy, that was one big snake!'

"Going up the wall
 Once climbers went to the mountains. Now a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. 

The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. 
The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. 
Until the mid-1960s,climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. During the winter they would either tolerate the cold weather, go walking instead or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. 
However, as the sport developed it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. This allowed them to keep their fingers strong, and beat off the boredom of not being able to climb. It wasn't long before many sports centres started building walls specifically for the task, using bricks with special edges to cling on to.
Many of these early walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education who, during the mid-1960s,constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University. Robinson developed the idea of setting natural rock in a block of concrete, which could then be included in a wall. 
Scores of climbing walls of this kind were built in sports halls up and down the country throughout the 1970s but they had obvious design problems. Walls could only be built in a vertical plane, whereas cliffs outside have features like overhangs and angled slabs of rock. There was the added drawback that once the walls were up they couldn't be altered and climbers would eventually tire of their repetitive nature, despite thinking of every combination of holds possible. 
In 1985,a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, developed a material which he moulded into shapes like those that climbers would find on the cliffs. These could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination. 
French manufacturers also began to experiment with panels on a steel framework. Concrete had proved too heavy to create overhanging walls without major building work, but steel frames could be erected anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers an endless supply of new holds. ",B2
"No Title 

On the very last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting to catch the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot more people waiting than I had expected. That airy, light, clean, polished feeling I generally got in the station had been lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage stuffed the benches, and swarms of college kids littered the floor with their bags.
A grey-haired man was walking around speaking to different strangers one by one. Well-off, you could tell: tanned skin, nice sweater, soft, beige car-coat. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I had been thinking I wouldn't mind talking to her myself. The man said, 'Would you by any chance be travelling to Philadelphia?'
'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?'
'No, New York, but I'll be ...'
'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and he moved toward the next bench.
Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to
Philadelphia?' When the woman told him, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say a thing, just marched on down the row to one of the matched-luggage couples. I straightened up from my pillar and drifted closer, looking toward the platform as if I had my mind on the train.
Well, I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't, of course.
No doubt, I struck him as unreliable. He just glanced quickly at me and then swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. By now he was looking seriously stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!'
She lowered her book. She was thirtyish, maybe thirty-five - older than I was, anyhow. A school- teacher sort. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Why, yes, I am.'
'Then could I ask you a favour?'
I stopped several feet away and frowned down at my left wrist. (Never mind that I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could sense how she went on guard. The man must have sensed it too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!'
They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples hauling their wheeled bags behind them like big pets on leashes. Next I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. So I put her on a train this morning, stopping for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife in a state. She hardly said ""hello"" to me. You see my daughter'd forgotten her passport. She'd telephoned home from the station in Philadelphia; didn't know what to do next.'
The woman clucked sympathetically. I'd have kept quiet myself. Waited to find out where he was heading with this.
'So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get somebody here to carry up her passport.'
A likely story! Why didn't he go himself, if this was such an emergency?
'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked him.
'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.'
This seemed like a pretty poor excuse, if you want my honest opinion. Also, it exceeded the amount of bad luck that one family could expect. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been the logical choice, but one of those padded envelopes the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked to be stapled shut besides. Watch yourself, lady, I said silently.",B2
"Hamlet was angry that she should give such a dear and respectful name as father to the murderer of his true father, and he replied, sharply, 'Mother, you have much offended my father.' The queen asked him if he had forgotten who he was speaking to.
'Oh!' replied Hamlet. 'I wish I could forget. You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; and you are my mother. I wish you were not what you are.' Taking her by the wrist, made her sit down. He wanted to try to make her understand everything that was wrong with the way she was living.
She was frightened by his strange manner and worried that, in his madness, he might harm her. She cried out, and a voice was heard from behind the curtains, 'Help, help, the queen!'
When Hamlet heard this, he thought it was the king himself who was hidden there. He pulled out his sword and struck at the place where the voice came from. At last the voice stopped and he believed the person to be dead. When he pulled out the body, though, he found that it was not the king - it was Polonius, the old minister, who had hidden there as a secret listener.
'Oh!' shouted the queen. 'What a foolish and bloody act!'
'A bloody act, mother,' replied Hamlet, 'but not as bad as yours, when you killed a king and married his brother.'
Hamlet had said too much to stop here. Even though the faults of parents should be treated gently by their children, in the case of great crimes a son may speak with some unkindness to his own mother, as long as that unkindness is meant for her good and to turn her from her bad ways.

"Dedicated to their sports

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
A Darius (runner)
I've always been sporty. I played a bit of everything at one time, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial for a professional football club, but eventually I opted to go down the athletics route instead. My biggest moment came when I got to compete for my country in the youth team and got a medal. It didn't result in much media attention, though, which was a shame. I'd been hoping some sponsorship would come out of it, because the training doesn't come cheap. I train at home all winter and then go away for three weeks, usually Florida, before the season starts. It's good fun - there are great athletics facilities there and the nightlife's great too. You've got to be really disciplined, though. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication pays in this sport. The main goal for me is to get to the next Olympics -that would be fantastic.

B Gabriel (surfer)
The surfing community is small, so you get to meet the same guys wherever you compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn, so if you're really going to get anywhere, you have to cut out late-night parties altogether. I don't mind that so much, but I do love having a lie-in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it,because without that kind of dedication I might not have won the National Championships last year. I make sure that a big night out follows any win, though, and if there's cash involved in the winnings, I'll go away somewhere really nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning that championship meant I got picked to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

C Dieter (yacht racer)
With five lads on a boat together, you have a good laugh. We're very traditional and we always celebrate a win in great style. It's been said that we act a bit childishly when we're out, but we don't actively go looking for media coverage. Sometimes the reporters actually seem more concerned about where you go out celebrating and what you get up to there than about where you came in the race. I'm away for eight months of the year, so it's great to get back, go out with my mates from other walks of life and do the things they do. You can't live, eat and breathe the sport all the time- it's not healthy. I'm known within the world of sailing, but fortunately I can count the number of times I've been recognised in the street on the fingers of one hand. I'd hate to become some sort of celebrity. I get a lot of nice letters from people wanting signed pictures, though. It may take ages, but I reply to every one. It would be cheeky to complain, even if it does take a bit of organising.

D Tomas (tennis player)
It's always a great thing to walk on court and feel that the crowd's behind you. At the last tournament, though, it all got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Despite that, I have to admit that I do still get quite a thrill out of being spotted by fans when I'm out shopping or something. It has its downside though. My last girlfriend didn't like it if I got too much attention from female fans. The thing is,tennis players have to travel quite a lot, and in the end that's why we split up, I guess. That was hard, but you've got to make sacrifices in any sport; you've got to be serious and professional. Actually, it doesn't really bother me too much. I'm content to concentrate on my game now and catch up on the other things in life once I've retired, because, after all, that comes pretty early in this sport.",B2
"Five-star luxury meets up-to-date technology
The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of considerable research into customer requirements and nearly two years' work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike.
At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel.
Though the system cost £250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers.
For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences.
Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort. Guests have the opportunity to change the temperature themselves within three degrees either side of the normal l8°C but, in addition, each individual room can be adjusted by any amount between 14°C and 25°C at the front desk.
For guests, though, it is the other technology offered in their rooms which is most likely to find favour. This is particularly true for the business user, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five per cent of his business will come from this part of the market. To provide the best service for such needs, the hotel has taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms. Each one has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.
Technology changes so quickly these days that the hotel has had to try to forecast possible improvements. Extra cables have been laid to handle whatever scientific advances may occur. The televisions are rented rather than bought, so that they can be replaced with more up-to- date models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.
Despite the presence of all this very up-to-the-minute equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried hard not to make guests feel threatened by technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms, large and well-furnished, are both comfortable and welcoming. There are, of course, a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars and two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the heart of it all.
As at all luxury hotels, the food that is offered to guests must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he agreed to move his restaurant business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel site has huge benefits, both for him and the hotel itself. He has been able to design a new kitchen and take it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at the previous address, too. From the hotel's side, they are able to offer a popular and successful place to eat, with no financial risks attached. Aided by technology and a highly capable staff, the Merrion looks likely to succeed.

"The Collectors 

Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and the reasons why so many people enjoy the same hobby.
 
I have always loved collecting and collectors and one in three adults indulges in this hobby. It is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm and delight. However, if you enter this world, remember one thing: in the end, if you do not fall in love with an object, do not collect it. 
Since the beginning of time, people have had the urge to collect. When primitive man collected pebbles, he hung them around his neck. Attracted by their shapes and colour, these pebbles represented man’s first attempts to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the intervening centuries, nothing much has changed. Small boys and girls still collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. 
I have been collecting all my life. Everything from flowers such as tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was of stones picked up in my parents’ garden. Aged six I had the good fortune, although it did not seem so at the time, to be sent to a school in a remote part of England, a cold and windy place surrounded by hills. When my parents came to visit me they used to take me to the local museum, which was full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. 
Surprisingly I am not alone in being interested in collecting objects. One in three adults indulges the same passion. The reasons why people collect has become a subject of great interest. The current thinking is that, for some individuals, it is the only aspect of their lives where they have complete control. For me, it’s just something I enjoy doing.
One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a ‘room of wonders’. This was a collection of natural and artificial curiosities. There were cups made from coconut shells, carved ivory beads and pieces of Oriental china. Another aristocrat, Catherine the Great of Russia, collected more than 4,000 paintings.
However, you do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. I have collected items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups, searching out examples of each type with incredible determination. I remember the day that I persuaded a fellow collector of tulips to part with one which I wanted to add to my collection. I planted it and watered it until one year it vanished – stolen by another collector. 
One collection that I made was of American rag dolls – 350 of them. I looked all over the USA for these dolls, searching out each variation in design with delight. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. Next morning, I stood inside the front hall and saw the remains of furniture and my collection. I am not certain which saddened me more!
It is, I suppose, the way that collections change hands that has always interested me. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king, a poet: it is this that gives value to the goods that are traded in the markets of the world. As small objects become a popular collector’s item, so they begin to rise in price. The toys of the 1950s are now positively an investment, provided of course, that you did not throw away the original boxes. (Not only did I put them in the bin, I also did the same to the contents.)

"Keeping the holiday-makers happy

A chalet girl’s work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. 

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d’Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. 
Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' 
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. 
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. ‘On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. 
Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' 
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay’s and perhaps Dick’s T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. ‘A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. ’We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. 
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' 
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. ’Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. ",B2
"There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas to discover that your baggage has been left behind. At best you will have to put up with wearing the clothes you stand up in for hours or days, until the airline reunites you with your luggage. At worst, you may be in a different climate zone, thousands of miles from home and forced to wear wholly unsuitable clothes.
Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. Even the best airlines slip up from time to time, and it is impossible for any carrier to guarantee that a passenger's checked luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when a journey calls for one or more changes of aircraft. 
The system works like this. Airlines insist on exaggerated check-in times (which require passengers to report to the airport at a given time before departure) designed to allow sufficient time for baggage to pass through the airport and be loaded on to the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time it takes to transfer between two flights. These, too, are exaggerated to allow for baggage transfers. 
In normal circumstances the system works well. But extra security checks at airports and problems with air traffic combine to cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. Then there is the possibility of human error, or an accident in which the destination label is torn off. 
These problems can become severe at large transfer airports, known as 'hubs', because of the large number of bags that are processed. Last year, for example, London's Heathrow airport handled more than 41 million passengers, of whom nine million were changing planes. British Airways alone handled two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with most making the one-mile transfer between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European 
flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). 
Even efficient transfer airports, such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore and Zurich have their bad days. The risk of baggage being lost when changing planes is higher than average at certain airports. Even the United States has problems - Miami airport is well known for luggage going missing when transatlantic passengers make immediate connections for destinations in Latin America. 
You should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If a change of plane is unavoidable, or makes your flight less expensive, then try to fly the same airline throughout. Try to allow more connecting time by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure you label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. 
If, after all this, your luggage still goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.

"In my opinion, history would have been better if women had been the dominant sex. 
History is men getting into trouble. History, as recorded by men, has traditionally been a chronology of wars. But would events have taken the same turn if history had been made and recorded by women? 
Most certainly not. If we now had a matriarchal society, conflicts between nations would look entirely different. Instead of going to war and killing your enemies, you would hurt their feelings - perhaps you would make remarks about the children in the other country: 'Your children are ugly and have bad table manners.' 
If you said something like that, both of you would feel so terrible that you'd talk about it. There'd be a lot of communication. 
Naturally, if women were in charge, the telephone would have been invented very, very early - right after the wheel. 
I am not saying a matriarchal society would be perfect. I am saying it would be much more peaceful. No society run by women would send its sons and daughters to be slaughtered by the sons and daughters of another society run by women. 
In fact, if roles had been established differently, armed aggression would simply not occur, partly because no one would want anyone else's land. After all, why would you want someone else's land? You can visit. If you own more land, you have to look after it. 
Women historians would certainly not define crucial moments in history by events on the battlefield. If they had their way, instead of 'Our glorious victory over XYZ', Chapter 12 of your history book might be 'When We Learned That If You Wash Your Hands You Get Sick Less.'

"It’s a tough job? 

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they’re as wonderful as they seem. 

A. Raquel Graham 

Raquel Graham rings from the taxi taking her to the airport. She can’t make our appointment tomorrow because her boss wants her to be in Los Angeles instead. When you’re personal assistant to a pop star, you’re expected to jet around the world at the drop of a hat. Raquel loves her job and gets on well with her boss. 
There’s just one minor problem – she can’t stand flying. ‘On a nine-hour trip to California I usually take sleeping tablets to help calm me down,’ she admits. Her worst experience was being on Concorde. ‘It seemed so shut in with those tiny windows.’ 
Offices in Manchester and London occupy her when she comes down to earth. There’s some mundane paperwork to get through – organising the diary, sitting in on meetings with solicitors and accountants, sorting out itineraries and making yet more travel arrangements. 
She didn’t apply for the job. A chance meeting with the manager of a pop group led to the offer of work behind the scenes and she took a secretarial certificate at evening classes at the same time. Five years later she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. 

B. David Brown 

David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy; a man who carries a golfer’s bags. On the whole, he preferred the golf. Well, so would you if golf was your passion. There were drawbacks however. A small flat fee is on offer, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000 and much of that will go on travel and hotels. 
He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. ‘You’re not just carrying bags. You’re offering advice, pitting your knowledge against the elements and trying to read the course.’ 
His accountancy skills were recently recognised by European Tour Productions when they made him statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyses the statistics of each day’s play. The results are sought after by television commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. 

C. Martin Fern 

Martin Fern is the editor of the ‘Food and Drink’ pages of a daily newspaper and one of his less difficult tasks is to sample what’s on offer in the finest restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge exorbitant prices? ‘For those who can afford it, it’s up to them,’ he says. ‘I’d rather spend £120 on a meal I’ll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.’ 
It was his talent as a cook that led to the offer of a food column from a friend who happened to edit a Saturday Review. For Martin, at the time creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful secondary income. He was 42 when another newspaper rang to offer a full-time job. ‘It meant a 50 per cent cut in guaranteed income,’ he says. ‘But it was a chance to convert my passion into a profession.’ 
He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. 

D. Dick Prince 

‘I started writing children’s stories about 20 years ago,’ says Dick Prince, one of Britain’s most popular children’s writers. ‘Before that, I had always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing had mainly been verse. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer, and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. 
So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children’s story.’ 
Where do his ideas come from? ‘Well, it’s not easy, I have to work at them,’ he says. ‘That is what I usually do in the mornings. I’m not up with the dawn, I’m afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning’s scribbling – all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. 
I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.’ ",B2
"Confident people what's their secret?

Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it.

A Jenny

When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course.
There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place.

B Michaela

It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself.
If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears!

C Lisa

People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. Interviewing people has helped me realise that most - if not all - of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we speak to someone who's genuinely friendly. The best ever piece of advice came from my mother when I was agonising as a teenager about wearing the right clothes. She simply cried, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too busy worrying about how they look.' I've found that's well worth remembering.
I also think you gain confidence by tackling things that scare you. When I took my driving test I was so nervous, but I passed. After that I felt sure that I'd never feel so frightened again, and I never have.

D Barbara

My confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work I do, but it's something that I've built up over the years. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round. I work hard and I'm popular in the restaurant, but it's probable that one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that affect me. You've got to like yourself for what you are, not try to be what others expect.
My company runs a lot of training courses, and going on those has built up my self-esteem. The company also encourages employees to set manageable targets. It helps no end if you can see you're achieving something tangible, rather than reaching for the stars all at once, and ending up with nothing but air!

E Kim

After I left college I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing with what was being said, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I summoned up the confidence to start making my point. Even so, when I first worked in politics, I'd never spoken in public before and always used to shake like a leaf. I would say to myself, 'Don't be so silly. People do this every day of their lives, so there's no reason why you can't.' I also found it helpful to jot a few things down to refer to - rather like having a comfort blanket!
I don't think there is anyone who isn't a little shaky when it comes to talking publicly. The real secret of confidence lies in telling yourself over and over again, 'Nothing is impossible.'",B2
"Studio Audiences 

What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. 

Like technical difficulties,studio audiences are just another common feature of television life,and yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows, for example, we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? 
Of all the audiences for live entertainment, the studio variety is widely considered to be the lowest of the low. I have heard it said that even people who work in television treat studio audiences with scorn - or, as one cameraman put it,'like cattle'. 
I had assumed that studio audiences were made up of silly people desperate for two seconds of fame. But there's no such thing as a typical studio audience. They come from all classes, professions and income groups. Television tries to attract different types of people for different types of programme. 
Those of us who prefer to watch television from home can't see why anyone would want to watch television from a studio. Why would anyone bother to apply for tickets, travel long distances, and suffer hours of boredom in the discomfort of a studio just to watch what they can see at home? 
One theory is that people hope that for a second they might appear on television. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela: ‘Why had she come?’ It was a chance to appear on television.' Another theory is that people are curious to take a look behind the scenes. But the most common explanation I heard was simply a case of 'a friend gave me a ticket'. 
Few of us have ever sat in a studio audience, yet we think we can imagine what it is like. You sit there, squashed among strangers, while someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means. As one studio manager puts it, 'We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' 
But is there any real difference between what you experience in a studio and what you see on your television at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte liked the feeling of involvement with live television. 'Last year I saw my favourite comedian. When you see him on television at home you miss out on a lot.' 
What I missed out on was the sight of live actors - from where I was sitting all I could see was the back of somebody's head. The opening scenes were shot so far from where I sat that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor. Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment. ",B2
"Father and son start Gold Rush 

Terence and Chris Madden have travelled from Canada's frozen north to the heat of Africa in their search for nature's most desired metals. The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. 
After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced that they are just metres away from a five million dollar vein of gold. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to get a few more metres to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. 
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. Their search began after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town of the same name. While reading 19th century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the most promising area of land to study. 
Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. They then set about digging out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to form a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. 
Now they are running short of money. Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they will have to convince a backer to put £50,000into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' 
As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started turning the heads of the inhabitants as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. 'It would encourage more people to come here if they are right,' said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, 'but if these two find gold I hope millions of people are not going to come and hack away at the hillside.' 
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s, when thousands were employed in hundreds of mines dotted around the countryside. One of the last remaining mines at Clogau-St David's, which produced wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. 
Now, however, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. 'Searching for gold is very emotional,' said Hall, 70. 'It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time.' ",B2
"No Title

We always went to Ireland in June. Ever since the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have had to add to the building, but everything has been done most discreetly.
It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He'd come across an advertisement in the days when the Malseeds still felt the need to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel that had been recommended by friends, but it hadn't been a success because the food was so appalling.
The four of us have been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. They call me Milly, though strictly speaking my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good, I suppose. He and Strafe were at school together, which must be why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think.
'How ve1y nice,' Mrs Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. Some instinct seems to tell her when guests are about to arrive, for she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she commanded the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs Malseed herself painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.
'Well, well, well,' Mr Malseed said, now entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish manner. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us think we were rather more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, causing eve1yone in the hall to laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, canying as much of our luggage as he could manage and returning for the remainder.
After dinner we played cards for a while but not going on for as long as we might because we were still quite tired after the journey. In the lounge there was a man on his own and a French couple. There had been other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window we could see some of them strolling about the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere.
I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.",B2
"In the weeks before the end of the tax year everyone in the firm was especially busy. With no wife to go home to, Mitch worked later than anyone else. Besides, he had extra work to do. One night, at three in the morning, he unlocked Avery's office on the fourth floor with one of the keys Abby had given him. He
remembered a lot of the names of the files on Tammy's list. He unlocked the file cupboards and found what he was looking for.
He carried the papers over to the photocopier near Avery's office. Every file in the firm had a number, and none of the copiers in the building would start until they were programmed with a file number. Mitch programmed the machine with the number of an innocent file which was sitting on his desk downstairs,
and copied all 128 pieces of paper. He returned this file to Avery's office and came back with another one. He programmed in a different number. That night he used eighteen file numbers from his own files and three he borrowed from Lamar Quin's files.
A wire led from the copier through a hole in the wall and down the inside of a cupboard, where it joined wires from three other copiers on the fourth floor. This new, larger wire ran down to the third floor, where a computer recorded every copy made within the firm, so that they could bill the proper client. An innocent-looking grey wire ran from this computer up through the fourth floor to the fifth, where another computer recorded the same information, and added the details of which machine was used to make the copies.

"Changing lives with a Stranger

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire.
'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is such a tranquil, peaceful place - and here I was rushing around when I could be sitting quietly giving an animal a cuddle. Some of the members of the fashion team seemed quite stressed - my job doesn't really get pressurised. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, it made me laugh to think that I'd usually be cleaning out cages or handling rats. I'm fascinated to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo so I'll stay put.'
Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo.
'I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave thme a green polo shirt instead to work in -which was just as well, as I got very dirty. As I stroked one of the elephants, I reckoned Mandie would probably be packing up clothes in the cupboard. By five o'clock, I stank but I'd had such a brilliant day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants - but maybe in Africa.'
Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went on location with the television gardening programme Ground Force.
'I was extremely excited about meeting the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the programme presenter, was really nice. One of the things I liked was the chance to be in the fresh air. Depending on my shifts, I sometimes never see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was great fun. I thought I was pretty strong but I felt weak compared with the rest of the team. My romantic vision of landscape gardening had not included physical hard work or meticulous planning. I was more an enthusiastic than effective gardener, so I don't plan to give up my other job.'
Charlie Dimmock, landscape gardener with the TV programme Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital.
'I made beds and handed out tablets. I expected to faint when I was doing some jobs, but I amazed myself by finding that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt tremendously 'girlie' compared with my normal male environment. I feel my job is a real waste of time compared with nursing. My day at the hospital was not exactly pleasant but it left me with a great sense of satisfaction.'
Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with the airline Ryanair as a member of the cabin crew.
'I changed into the uniform, and the moment I put it on I felt completely different- people suddenly look up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor told us about safety, what to do if someone had a heart attack-which I knew about from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me and I felt very self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to look after.'
Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with the airline Ryanair, spent the day as a personal trainer in a gym.
'I was dreading doing this swap as I don't do any exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was very surprised at lunch to see that some of the trainers didn't eat ultra-healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be a bit healthier.'",B2
"IN HOT WATER

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean.
Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teach- ing, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots.'They are used to these conditions, which mean they can't stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. Adive can last for 16hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button.' The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. 'No one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.'
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but Ido it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"".' This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. 
The relief was incredible - we were still alive!’
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had 
studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was such an amazing feeling.'",B2
"The kingfisher

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers,feeding on fish.
Old trees overhang the stream, half shading shallow water. Soft greens, mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours, as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast, a slice of light and motion so striking you almost feel it. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers, its power out of proportion to its size.
Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. A sure sign of his depth of feeling for this little bird is his inability to identify just what it is that draws him to it. After all, it is the stuff of legend. Greek myth makes the kingfisher a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another tale tells how the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body took on the blue of the sky,while its underparts were scorched by the sun.
There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue.
This is why a kingfisher may appear to change from bright blue to rich emerald green with only a slight change in the angle at which light falls on it. It's small wonder that some wildlife photographers get so enthusiastic about them. Couple the colours with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of direct human approach, can be easy to watch from a hideout, and you have a recipe for a lifelong passion.
Charlie Jame’s first hideout was an old blanket which he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favourite spot. The bird came back within minutes and sat only a metre away. But it took another four years, he reckons, before he got his first decent picture. In the meantime, the European kingfisher had begun to dominate his life. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream.
The trouble was, school cut the time available to be with the birds. So he missed lessons, becoming what he describes as an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only member of its cosmopolitan family to breed in Europe, was getting noticed.
At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman. What he'd really like to do now is make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech,just beautiful images which say it all,' he says. 'I'm attracted to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings ...'
The sentence trails off to nothing. He's thinking of those colours of the bird he's spent more than half his life close to, yet which still excites interest. The photographs succeed in communicating something of his feelings. But, as Charlie knows, there's so much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can ever show.",B2
"Film Critic

Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page.
Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff.
At first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable.
It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time: a new newspaper, and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. In fact, the first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of my reviews appeared, I didn't know where to look.
Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film.
The luxury of this way of working suits me well. I wouldn't have been interested in the more standard film critic's role, which involves considering every film that comes out. That's a routine that would make me stale in no time at all. I would soon be sinking into my seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What insulting rubbish must I sit through now?' - a style of sigh that can often be heard in screening rooms around the world.
The space I am given allows me to broaden my argument - or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. There is also such a thing as loyalty to 'type' or its opposite. It can only rarely happen that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story addict avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say.
So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be.",B2
"The happiness of these lovers was sadly destroyed at this moment by the entrance of a messenger, who brought a letter from Antonio containing terrible news. When Bassanio read Antonio's letter, he looked so pale that Portia feared it was to tell him of the death of some dear friend. 
She asked what the news was which had upset him so much, and he said, 'Oh, sweet Portia, here are some of the most unpleasant words that were ever written. Gentle lady, when I first spoke to you of my love, I admitted that all the wealth I had was my high-born blood; but I should have told you that I had less than nothing, since I am in debt.' 
Bassanio then told Portia about how he had borrowed money from Antonio, and about Antonio borrowing it from Shylock, and about the legal agreement by which Antonio had promised to
give a pound of flesh if the money were not paid back by a certain day. And then Bassanio read Antonio's letter to her; the words of which were:
Dear Bassanio,
My ships are all lost, I must pay Shylock, and since I cannot both pay and live, I would like to see you at my death. But do as you please; if your love for me does not make you come, do not let my letter
influence you.
'Oh, my dear love,' said Portia, 'finish your business and be gone. You shall have gold to pay the money back 20 times over before this kind friend loses even a hair for helping you.' Portia then said she wanted to be married to Bassanio before he left, to give him a legal right to her money.

"A NEW LIFE
The Farmer
Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm.
'After 14 years in business, I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. But I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years when I was made redundant. It came out of the blue. I didn't get a particularly good pay-off but it was enough to set up the farm with. My break came when I got to know the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. Through supplying them, my reputation spread and now I also supply meat through mail order. I'm glad
I'm no longer stuck in the office but it's astonishing how little things have changed for me: the same 80- to 90-hour week and still selling a product.'
The Painter
Ron Able white was a manager in advertising but now makes a living as an artist.
'My painting began as a hobby but I realised I was getting far more excitement out of it than out of working. The decision to take redundancy and to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I talked to was very helpful. I think I was the first person who had ever told him, ""I don't want to go back to where I've been."" He was astonished because the majority of people in their mid-forties need to get back to work immediately- they need the money. But we had married young and our children didn't need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We went to the north of England, where we didn't know a soul. It meant leaving all our friends, but we've been lucky in that our friendships have survived the distance - plenty of them come up and visit us now.'
The Haymaker
After working for five years asa company lawyer, Katherine Goodison set up her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients.
'My job as a lawyer was fun. It was stimulating and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were terrible. I realised I didn't want to become a senior partner in the company, working more and more hours, so I left. A lot of people said I'd get bored, but that has never happened. The secret is to have deadlines. Since it's a fashion-related business,you have the collections, next year's shapes,the season-there's always too much to do, so you have to run a very regimented diary. I feel happier now, and definitely less stressed. There are things I really long for, though, like the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I'm totally responsible for the product. If I do a rubbish job, then I'm the one who takes the blame. Of course, you care when you're working for a company, but when your name is all over the promotional material, you care that little bit more.'
The Masseur
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London.
'I had been in financial markets from the age of 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but I never found the work rewarding. I was nearly made redundant in 1989, but I escaped by resigning and travelling for a year. I spent that year trying to work out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the world's best gymnasiums and talked to the owners about how they started up. I knew that to change career I had to get qualifications so I did various courses in massage.Then I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I never used to feel in control, but now I have peace of mind and control of my destiny. That's best of all.'",B2
"Over the past fifteen years, my research has documented that, for many, online life and smartphone connections have got in the way of things that people feel are important. We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think, we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation. We'd rather text than talk. It makes us feel more in control. 
A young woman Skypes her grandmother in another city but does her email during these conversations. She tells me that she hardly pays attention to what her grandmother is saying. The young woman does not feel good about these conversations, although her grandmother seems pleased. A mother explains that she cannot resist the 'little red light' telling her that she has a new message on her BlackBerry, even when she is driving on the motorway with her children in the car. The unread message, that red light, has come to stand for our feelings of hope. That someone wants us, that something new is coming into our lives. A woman explains that when she was in hospital, her
husband worked from her bedside but was so busy with his device that he didn't talk to her.
Children complain about parents texting at breakfast and dinner. Parents at the playground push a swing with one hand and scroll through their messages with the other. I go to a funeral and people are texting, hiding their phones under their hymn books. I remember, not so long ago, when a student remarked on the first time a friend interrupted a conversation to take a call. 'It made me feel like he was putting me on pause,' he said. Now, we all treat each other as 'pausables'.

"Keeping the holiday-makers happy

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners.
This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m: to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says.
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. ‘There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.'
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don’t want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.’ 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now.
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m. Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.",B2
"An eye for detail

Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.
With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently. She now employs an extra gardener but, despite the need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.",B2
"In April 1919, the British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar. As people gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi, a British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries, there were hundreds of deaths. 
Despite the violence and anger that followed, Mohandas Gandhi was able to organise non-violent protests such as a boycott of British goods. But how could peaceful resistance force the British to leave India? 
Gandhi began a campaign of non-cooperation with the British authorities. Parents stopped sending their children to British schools, people refused to go to British law courts and others walked out of their jobs for the government. 
The British tax on salt also became a concern for Gandhi. In a hot country like India, salt was important to everyone and the tax represented an enormous amount of money for the British. So Gandhi began a new campaign with a march across the country to collect salt without paying tax. 
Thousands of people joined him but the authorities could do nothing about it as going for a walk was not a crime. Gandhi finally reached the end of his journey at the town of Dandi, where he broke the law by producing salt. 
The British arrested him as soon as they could but now millions of people had joined his campaign and the world was watching. Civil disobedience spread across India and this brought forward the end of the empire.

"What had happened? Where had she gone? There was much confusion on the stage and in the audience. Raoul had cried out. Count Philippe had jumped up in his box. People looked at them and wondered if this event was connected in any way with the paragraph in the morning's paper. 
Raoul hurriedly left his seat, the count disappeared from his box, and everyone in the audience spoke at once, trying to suggest an explanation. At last, the curtain rose and one of the singers said in a serious voice, ""Christine Daas has disappeared in front of our eyes . . . and nobody can tell us how!""
Behind the curtain, there was a crowd of singers, dancers, scenery men-and all were asking questions and shouting. Three men stood together, talking in a low voice, looking desperately worried. 
They were Gabriel, the singing master, Mercier, the scenery manager, and Remy, the secretary. They were anxious to tell the managers about Christine Daas's disappearance. But the managers were in their office, and they had given orders that they were not to be bothered. 
Remy made several attempts to persuade them to open the door of their office, and when he finally succeeded, Monsieur Montcharmin only shouted at him, ""Do you have a safety pin?"" When Remy answered that he did not, Monsieur Montcharmin shouted at him to go away. 
Then he continued shouting for a safety pin until a boy brought him one, which he took-then quickly shut the door in Remy's face. Remy returned to tell Gabriel and Mercier that he was unable to communicate the message of Christine Daas's disappearance to the managers. Mercier decided to go and tell them himself.

"Running a business in the countryside 

Five women talk about their experiences setting up a business in the countryside. 

A.
‘My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over £200,000 a year and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small, and I wanted work I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I was married, so my husband suggested I set up a computer-aided design business. It needed a huge amount of money and things were difficult in the beginning. But I have been very careful, making sure that I told the bank manager if I was likely to overspend. Being in the house is a big saving, and I can carry on working in the evening if I want. It has remained a small business. We hardly ever deliver work - people from the area tend to collect it from us.' 

B.
’I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who works from home as a designer of greetings cards. 'I trained in art at university, and wanted to work in a museum. But when I married, we went to live in the countryside, where there wasn't that sort of work. So I decided to set up my own business and I produce a range of 50 greetings cards which I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The disadvantage of working from home is that there is always something that needs doing - like mowing the lawn. My business comes completely by word of mouth - I don't advertise at all. People send work down from London as I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't get to exchange ideas with other people any more, but generally there are more advantages than disadvantages.' 

C.
’It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, whose curtain-making business has seen good times and bad. 'I started my business eight years ago. Then this type of business was expanding, and in two years my turnover went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to sack them because of the decline in the economy, which was painful because it is not easy to find other jobs in this area. I am right back almost to where I started, making the curtains at home myself, with my husband's help, and using women who work from their homes.

TESSA STRICKLAND runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. The first was financial, because London was so expensive, and the second was because I love the country. I enjoy being able to work when I want to. Eighty per cent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The disadvantage is that it requires discipline to shut the office door. I publish children's books from cultures around the world, working with authors and artists. All my professional experience had been in London, so I used to feel very alone at first.'

MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes, using good quality flour and eggs. Then I started getting requests from friends and relatives, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago I rented a small building and everything is made there - we have a baker and assistant, and a professional cake-icer. I don't cook at all now, as I run the commercial side. My greatest problem has been the financial side of the business, which has been difficult simply because we didn't have an enormous amount of money to set up with.' ",B2
"So concerned that the document would leave the United States, the American businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein was prompted into action – securing the document for $21.3m at auction. His plan was to put the document back on display. On acquiring the centuries-old parchment a delighted Rubenstein made his plans clear: ""I am privileged to be the new owner, but I am only the temporary custodian. This is a gift to the American people.""

"The World's End murder trial.
The 2007 acquittal of Angus Sinclair, later revealed as a serial killer, sparked a profound change in Scotland's judicial system.
Sinclair was cleared of raping and killing two teenage girls after they left Edinburgh's World's End pub in October 1977. At the trial the prosecutor had failed to put vital forensic evidence before the jury, but by law Sinclair could not be tried twice for the same crime. The case led to legislation in 2011 which allowed this given 'compelling new evidence'. Sinclair was tried again in 2014, convicted and jailed. England and Wales ended double jeopardy in 2003, and Northern Ireland in 2005.
Trial in secret.
In 1923 Lord Chief Justice Hewart coined the phrase: 'Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.'
This key legal principle was challenged in 2014 when the Crown Prosecution Service sought to stage an Old Bailey trial in total secrecy. When this bid was overturned by the Court of Appeal the trial, of 26-year-old suspected London terrorist Erol Incedal, was held in partial secrecy. Some evidence was heard completely in secret. Incedal, a law student, was found guilty of possessing a bomb-making document. No trial has yet taken place in its entirety without public and media access.
There is a justification for defendants to be anonymous and there is jurisdiction for the court to sit in private.",B2
"Onto a winner

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business.
Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico, USA, and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. They are playing the ancient game of pichenotte, one which, they insist, is unlike any other.
Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer originally from Quebec, Canada, brought the game into the USA and introduced it to his family. It wasn't long before, on just about every weekend and holiday, the family were playing the game and, as Dave says, 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he'd made out of old wooden food crates, was not forgotten and they continued to play regularly. If visitors dropped by they were often fascinated, for the game was completely unknown in southern USA.
One day, three years ago, Dave set up the ancient pichenotte board and, realising how cracked and battered it had become, decided to make a new one. This turned out to be a beauty. A relative noticed and wanted one. Then a friend wanted another. Curious as to how great the interest might be, one night the brothers took one of Dave's new game boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People there started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and pretty soon you couldn't them up from the table!'
When people started asking about the origins of the game, Dave decided to do some research. The roots, he discovered, were probably in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. That was adapted into a game called 'squails' which was played in pubs in Britain and, a century ago, British people emigrating to Canada brought the game with them. Pichenotte is the name of the French-Canadian version of the game that developed in Quebec.
Pichenotte, which can be played by two to four people, is clearly a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. Three concentric rings around the hole are worth 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Eight tiny posts present obstacles. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
When they saw how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made a couple more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money changed hands and the game's popularity grew. So much so that championships began to take place and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. With word spreading more widely, the boards began to sell as fast as the brothers could make them. Eventually, they decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time.
They set up a workshop in the garage of their house and started turning out boards. More than 450 have been produced to date. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each weighs 12kg and is lcm thick. As Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of wear.' They are available, at $595 each, from the brothers' website.
As yet, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to produce pichenotte celebrities. Nonetheless, the day is not far off when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury Mercedes rather than a saw and piles of wood. Until then, they're happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune.",B2
"What would happen to our planet if humans were to suddenly disappear? 
This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear. In one chapter, there is an analysis of how New York would survive if there were no humans to take care of it. 
The size and solidity of New York is such that the very idea that nature could just swallow it up seems absurd. However, New York's vulnerability is greater than it appears and it would take less time for nature to get rid of humanity's terrible impact on the planet than we think. 
Before the arrival of people there were marshes, lakes, streams and springs and they are still there under the streets. According to New York City engineers, without power to run the pumps the city's subway system will flood within 36 to 48 hours and small ponds and streams will appear on the surface. 
Within a few years of the disappearance of people, craters will appear and streets like Lexington Avenue will become rivers again. Plant growth will start immediately and, after five years, trees will have started their colonisation of the streets. 
After five years with no maintenance, the deterioration of buildings will have begun.  After several decades, creepers will have climbed up the sides of the decaying buildings. New York's bridges will also start to suffer with nobody to look after them. 
First, exposure to hot summers and cold winters will crack concrete and damage the metal structures, which will also be attacked by rust.

"The police car, which had been called from the main police station at Markhampton, drove quickly around the edge of the American airfield and on up the village street. It was half past eight on a fine spring morning, and the road was empty except for a line of the American army cars that now seemed to be a common sight on the country roads of that particular part of England. 
Sergeant Place of the Markshire Police, who was sitting beside the young driver, looked at them with little pleasure. It was not that he had any real objection to Americans. On the whole, they did not behave worse than the local people. But when they did behave badly, the way in which they did so was different. This was, in itself, an offence to Place, who had been brought up to believe in the regular order of things. 
Consider this business at Hawthorn House, for example - there was sure to be an American mixed up in it, and that would cause trouble. Hawthorn House was an old, rather dark little house which stood by itself on the far side of the village. There were many like it in the area. The owners rented them out to visiting army officers, and profited greatly by asking high rents. As the police car reached the entrance, the police doctor's car came up behind it, and the three men went into the house together.
Sergeant Place was rather relieved when the door was opened by someone who was clearly an Englishman - a middle-aged man with rather unhealthy skin, wearing the dull clothes of a manservant.

"'But at least they must give me back my shoes!' cried Passepartout, in an angry voice.
They gave him his shoes.
'They have cost a lot of money,' he said. 'More than a thousand pounds each! And they do not fit very well, either.'
Passepartout, in a very unhappy state of mind, followed Mr Fogg, who had offered his arm to Aouda. Fix still hoped that the robber (as he thought Mr Fogg to be) would never agree to lose the two thousand pounds, and that he would go to prison for seven days. All the same, he followed him closely.
Mr Fogg took a carriage, and Aouda, Passepartout and he took their places in it. Fix ran behind it until they reached the port, where the carriage stopped. Half a mile out to sea was the steamer Rangoon. It was eleven o'clock, and Mr Fogg was one hour early.
Fix saw him get down from the carriage and, with his companions, take his place in a boat which set off immediately in the direction of the Rangoon. The detective stamped his feet with disappointment.
'He has gone!' he cried. 'And two thousand pounds have gone too! The thief! I will follow him to the end of the world, but at the rate he is spending the money, there will be nothing left of what he has stolen!'
The detective had some reason for thinking this. Mr Fogg had, as a matter of fact, spent more than five thousand pounds since he had left London - and as the money grew less, so also did any reward that the detective could hope for when this affair was over.

"So you want to be an actor

If you tell someone that you want to make a career as an actor, you can be sure that within two minutes the word 'risky' will come up. And, of course, acting is a very risky career - let there be no mistake about that. The supply of actors is far greater than the demand for them. 
Once you choose to become an actor, many people who you thought were your closest friends will tell you you're crazy, though some may react quite differently. No two people will give you the same advice. But it is a very personal choice you are making, and only you can take responsibility for yourself and for realising your ambition. 
There are no easy ways of getting there - no written examinations to pass, and no absolute guarantee that when you have successfully completed your training you will automatically make your way in the profession. It's all a matter of luck plus talent. Yet there is a demand for new faces and new talent, and there is always the prospect of excitement, glamour and the occasional rich reward. 
I have frequently been asked to define this magical thing called talent, which everyone is looking out for. I believe it is best described as natural skill plus imagination - the latter being the most difficult quality to assess. And it has a lot to do with the person's courage and their belief in what they are doing and the way they are putting it across. 
Where does the desire to act come from? It is often very difficult to put into words your own reasons for wanting to act. Certainly, in the theatre the significant thing is that moment of contact between the actor on the stage and a particular audience. And making this brief contact is central to all acting, wherever it takes place - it is what drives all actors to act. 
If you ask actors how they have done well in the profession, the response will most likely be a shrug. They will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job, and that their fame may not continue. 
Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. Last month you may have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly you are asked to audition for a part, but however much you want the job, the truth is that it may be denied you. So actors tend not to talk about their chances. They come up with ways of protecting themselves against the stress of competing for a part and the possibility of rejection. 
Nobody likes being rejected. And remember that the possibility is there from the very first moment you start going in for parts professionally. You are saying that you are available, willing and, hopefully, talented enough for the job. And, in many ways, it's up to you, for if you don't care enough, no-one will care for you. ",B2
"So Uncle Oscar signed the agreement, and Paul's mother received the whole five thousand. Then something very strange happened. The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them. 
There was new furniture, and Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton, his father's school, in the following autumn. There were flowers in the winter. And still the voices in the house, behind the flowers and under the beds, cried: 'There must be more money! Oh, there must be more money. Oh, now, more than ever, there must be more money!'
It frightened Paul terribly. He studied his Latin and Greek, but his most important hours were spent with Bassett. The Grand National had gone by: he had not 'known', and had lost a hundred pounds. Summer was near. He was terribly anxious about the Lincoln. But even for the Lincoln he didn't 'know', and he lost fifty pounds. He became wild-eyed and strange, as if something were going to explode in him.
'Leave it alone,' said Uncle Oscar. 'Don't trouble yourself about it!' But it seemed as if the boy couldn't really hear what his uncle was saying.
'I've got to know for the Derby! I've got to know for the Derby!' the child said again and again, his big blue eyes flaming with a sort of madness.
His mother noticed how upset he was.
'You'd better go to the seaside. Wouldn't you like to go now to the seaside, instead of waiting? I think you'd better,' she said, looking down at him anxiously, her heart strangely heavy because of him.

"Careers Advice 

You're not happy in your job at the moment, but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. 

 
The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. A summary of the findings is then given and various careers are suggested, as well as the possible retraining needed. 
I decided to try out Career Analysts, one of the largest organisations giving career advice. Taking the careers test was like being back in my science exams. I was with a group of about ten people and we were answering questions against the clock. I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometrics would give an accurate picture of me. They involved things like picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching up similar shapes in a set. 
I then had a long chat with an adviser and from this, plus the results of the test, he produced a report giving his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the adviser's conclusions, though I was a little dismayed to find out that I had done quite badly in the scientific, technical and practical tests. I am sure that a lot of sick people are glad that I never became a nurse. It was reassuring, though, to be told that I had made the correct decisions as far as journalism was concerned. 
Rethinking your career needn't involve a massive change of direction. Last March, after working as a marketing manager with a large insurance company for five years, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. 'Losing my job was the perfect opportunity for me to take a step back and look at my career to date. I wanted to re-examine the skills and interests I have,' says Donna. Some of the results were surprising. 'I hadn't realised that I had such a gift for design. But in the end I had to balance the cost of retraining in design against my financial commitments,' she says. Other suggestions were put forward, such as taking a year off and working in the Far East. 
'I decided to use the skills I already had and move into something more suited to me than insurance. I am now working as a Public Relations officer. I am sure I would have got to this point without Career Analysts but they helped me realise, objectively and independently, what I definitely wanted to do. I have sent half a dozen friends there, who are all happy with the service.' 
There are those who feel that they definitely would not have got to that point without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make some life-changing decisions. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I decided my job was dull and I needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I went to Career Counselling Services with a completely open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was taped, which I found very useful, as you forget many of the things you say. After the fourth meeting, having listened carefully to what the results of the tests were telling me, I made the decision that I wanted to do geology and I plan to start a degree course in it later this year. I think that the advice given by Career Counselling Services was well worth the fee. I'm a lot happier now and far more positive.' 
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I had reached a stage in my career where I didn't know where to go. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something I had never thought of. Although I was given a host of new ideas, I rejected them as they either required a substantial drop in salary or considerable retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't know/ she says. 'You have to provide the adviser with an enormous amount of personal information and I just felt that if I had told a friend the same thing, they would have given me similar advice.' ",B2
"Treason legislation has often been caught in political eddies. After Henry VII ascended the English throne at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, he set the date of the start of his reign earlier than the battle and threatened the supporters of the defeated Richard III with treason. Men who had defended the ""rightful"" king were being accused of offences against the usurping king.
So in 1495, a treason act allowed a defence for those in this situation.
And the tumultuous political times of 1848 led to a treason act that dealt with people who advocated constitutional change rather than actual harm of the monarch.
The Treason Felony Act 1848 makes it an offence to deprive or depose the Queen from her established constitutional position - and to publish any writing or printing advocating such change.
""It was aimed at Chartists and Irish radicals,"" says Prof Lobban.
Six years earlier in 1842, the law on attempts to ""injure or alarm the sovereign"" had been strengthened, with specific reference to the use of firearms, following an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. This law was used in 1981 to prosecute Marcus Sarjeant after he fired blank cartridges in the vicinity of the Queen. He was jailed for five years.
One thing that can be said about the 1351 Treason Act and its successors is that they have been debated more in the late 20th and early 21st Century than they have ever been used for actual prosecutions.",B2
"IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT

What keeps film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their home comforts for months on end? The search for the perfect shot.
Of all the creatures to be found in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to track down must surely be producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman.
Their present habitat, the Ngorongoro Crater, has been lashed by six months of almost continuous rain, rise to a number of unforeseen problems. Newman explained that they had to invest in an expensive piece of equipment so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. His working partnership with the talented producer has created some of TV's finest wildlife films, such as their amazing and well-received film on leopards.
Even while this film of one of Africa's shyest cats was being shown, the pair were already back where they belong - this time trailing that equally shy animal, the jackal. But this is nothing unusual in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been constantly circling the globe, in order to point cameras at exotic wildlife ever since the birth of television.
I spoke to Newman about their partnership while he was making one of his rare and unpredictable reunions with other members of the human race at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we tend to get over them fairly quickly,' he says of his colleague. Neither of them regard themselves as the leader, and he says that one of the reasons why they get on so well with each other is that they both see the animals in a similar way.
'When we are on the move, we have to put up our tents each night. But this time we are operating much more of a fixed camp, and as we set out at 5 a.m. each morning, we tend to make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.'
The rest of the Newman-Barrett daily diet consists of pre-packed meals heated and dished out by whoever is at hand at the time. ‘It’s not unusual for us to be out and about for up to eight weeks at a time, so catering does cause the odd panic,' says Newman.
It can be a rough existence, but the appeal of being alone in such remote areas is that we can get close enough to the animals to become part of their lives. I remember once we were filming a family of lions and there was one lioness who would regularly go off on her own. Whenever she returned, she would go round and greet all the other members of the pride, and after a while she made a point of greeting our car as part of her round.'
It was back in 1988 that Newman first worked with Barrett on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two more years before they set off as a team to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to set aside four months on location to gather sufficient material for each half-hour film. And before they get the green light, they have to submit a script for approval.
'Amanda and I struck up a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because it was obvious that we shared the same ideas and overall vision. What we are always seeking to achieve is a film that is rich in atmosphere, that brings to life the true spirit of the place and animals, and that will touch people's hearts. I believe if you can evoke an emotional response from people, that is far better than if you appeal only to their heads.'

"THE SHELL ARTIST

At the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.

There are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list. For the moment though, he will stick to the skill that he has been delighted to perfect over the past ten years: making delicate and unusual objects out of shells.
'Tell me if I am boring you,' he says, as he leads me round his apartment showing me his work. There is a fine line between being a bore and being an enthusiast, but Cooke need not worry: he fits into the latter category, helped both by his charm and by the beauty of the things he makes.
He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. 'I shan't be at all bothered if people don't buy them because I have got so used to them, and to me they're adorable. I never meant to sell my work commercially. Some friends came to see me about five years ago and said, ""You must have an exhibition - people ought to see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery"".' The result was an exhibition in London, at which 70 per cent of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the enormous prices the pieces command - around £2,000 for the ornaments an empty space above the fireplace would seem a small sacrifice for Cooke to make.
There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists that he has nothing to do with the prices and is cheerily open about their level: he claims there is nobody else in the world who produces work like his, and, as the gallery-owner told him, 'Well, you're going to stop one day and everybody will want your pieces because there won't be any more.'
'I do wish, though,' says Cooke, 'that I'd taken this up a lot earlier, because then I would have been able to produce really wonderful things - at least the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing the best I can now, I'm more limited physically than I was when I started.' Still, the work that he has managed to produce is a long way from the common shell constructions that can be found in seaside shops. 'I have a miniature mind,' he says, and this has resulted in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.
Cooke has created his own method and uses materials as and when he finds them. He uses the cardboard sent back with laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker ('If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!') and washing-up liquid to wash the shells. 'I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,' he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, colour gradations and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.
Cooke's quest for beautiful, and especially tiny, shells has taken him further than his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa and the Philippines, to name but a few of the beaches where he has lain on his stomach and looked for beauties to bring home. He is insistent that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who write him letters accusing him of stripping the world's beaches. 'When I am collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why should I not collect them?' If one bases this argument on the amount of luggage that can be carried home by one man, the sum beauty of whose work is often greater than its natural parts, it becomes very convincing indeed.",B2
"Satire is the art of mocking those in power. To do this you need freedom of speech, a right which has its roots in Magna Carta of 1215. Satire is much older than that though - it's been around since ancient Greece.
Using your right to free speech in this way also means you run the risk of offending somebody. This can have tragic consequences, like the terrorist attacks in Paris on the staff of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
Satirists can highlight inequality and injustices in a society by using humour to exaggerate them. But pointing out that a problem exists is only the first step. Can satire really change how our politicians rule the country? To see how satire developed in Britain, we need to go back to the 18th Century.
Satire really took off in Britain during the 18th Century as the House of Commons and the prime minister began to draw additional powers away from the monarchy. Both became targets for the pens of satirists. To modern eyes some of these attacks are surprisingly vicious.
The notoriously corrupt prime minster Robert Walpole was compared to a highwayman in one opera.
Jonathan Swift highlighted the poverty in Ireland and subsequent famines with the shocking spoof proposal that the Irish should eat their babies. This led to public debate but Ireland's woes were to continue and worsen.
Yet it was a cartoonist who really had the powerful quaking in their boots. James Gillray's satirical cartoons were reprinted in newspapers and cleverly mocked politicians and the monarchy.
Gillray was so good at satire that he was even hired by the Tories to attack their rivals, the Whigs. One Tory complimented him by saying: ""You have been of infinite service in lowering them, and making them ridiculous.""",B2
"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'
For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.
This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.
Nevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.
As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.
The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.
However, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, members of the human race were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have got slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.

"By giving the police and intelligence agencies this authority, we ensure that our privacy is respected in accordance with the European Convention on Civil Rights and our own Human Rights Act. Recent judgments from the independent court confirm that we are not subject to mass surveillance. In a report to Parliament, the Interception Commissioner wrote:
“Public authorities do not misuse their powers to engage in random mass intrusion into the private affairs of law abiding UK citizens. It would be comprehensively unlawful if they did.""
At the same time, he confirms these powers are helping the authorities to make progress on our behalf against terrorists and criminals. For example:
Investigations using MI5 surveillance, GCHQ interception and other police powers have led to the uncovering and disruption of planned terrorist attacks against the UK.
International co-operation between law enforcement and industry has disrupted the command and control network for ‘Shylock’. ‘Shylock’ is computing banking ‘malware’ (malicious software). This ‘malware’ had infected at least 30,000 computers world-wide.
As confirmed by the Commissioner in his report, unless you associate with a potential terrorist, serious criminal or someone who could put UK national security at risk, none of the interception agencies have any interest in examining your emails, phone calls or post and will not do so in a way that could be regarded as significant.
On this anniversary of Magna Carta, we can be satisfied that our rights to security, privacy and freedom of expression are being upheld by our government, police and intelligence agencies.",B2
"Issue: You must decide whether to support a bill to increase the tax on a package of cigarettes by 25 cents. 
Merits of the case: The main arguments for increasing the tax are as follows.  First, the state is facing a budget deficit, and without additional revenues cuts will have to be made in a number of programs. Second, an increased price will discourage some people—and especially teenagers—from smoking. The main arguments for opposing a tax increase are as follows. First, cigarettes are now taxed at $2.00 per pack. Second, an additional tax is an unfair burden for those who choose to smoke. Third, higher cigarette prices will further encourage smuggling and the illegal sale of cheaper, untaxed cigarettes. 
Interest groups: The Tobacco Institute, supported by a number of tobacco companies, oppose the tax. The institute contributed $500 to your last campaign. The state chapter of the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association, as well as several other health groups, favor of the tax. They do not make campaign contributions. 
Political parties: Members of your party in the legislature have not yet taken a position on the issue. 
Constituents: Only about one of four of your constituents smoke. They are not organized, but a number have written to your office objecting to the tax increase.  Your non-smoking constituents have not taken any position; the issue is less important for them than it is for smokers. 
Convictions/record: In the past, you generally have favored increased taxes on tobacco products and have voted to restrict cigarette smoking in the workplace. You know that tobacco is harmful to one’s health, but believe that if people want to smoke they should be allowed to do so.",B2
"ICE SKATING 

Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes, skating was seen as an essential skill. 
In the early twentieth century, skating was stylish and reserved, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11- year-old Sonja Henie introduced a more athletic attitude which inspired a new wave of popularity. Nowadays art and athletics are combined and modern skating is both graceful and physically demanding. 
For the beginner, balance and control are all important and speed can only increase with proficiency. The position of your body plays a great part in balance. Legs slightly bowed and the knees bent keep the body weight centred; in effect the body leans slightly forward in this position. For skating, probably more than any other sport or recreation, relaxation is vital.
For the starting position, the heels should almost be touching and the feet should be turned outwards. While pushing forward with the back foot, you make a very small movement with the other foot. Fairly easy, isn't it? If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. 
Knowing how to fall must be learnt among the skater's first skills. Even the best of the professionals fall. In order to fall without injury, you should be as relaxed as possible. In this way the shock of hitting the ice is lessened. To get up, use your hands to get into a kneeling position, then stand. 
Once you have learnt to move on the ice with confidence, there are various styles to be practised - figure skating, free style, distance, speed, skating in pairs, and so on - but the basis of them all, and by far the best approach, is first to learn figure skating and then elementary freestyle. With proper guidance available at most of the ice rinks throughout the country, the basic figures can soon be learnt and the turns, jumps and spins of elementary free style will soon follow. 
If you look at any good or professional skater, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this an exercise programme should be regularly practised. It can be dangerous to skate with a stiff body and warm-up exercises should at least include those for the legs, back and shoulders, with special emphasis on the ankles and the knees. After a long or intense session, the same exercises should be used afterwards to avoid stiffness. 
Skating improves balance, co-ordination, relaxation and movement. It improves heart and lung activity and generally strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness. ",B2
"Busting the myth.
Florence Nightingale was so much more than a lady with a lamp. The legend of the saintly nurse has long obscured the truth – that her mathematical genius was what really saved so many lives.
Her ambition led her into the hellish world of Crimean warfare and, as a result, on a journey that would transform nursing and hospitals in Britain.
Florence was named after the Italian city of her birth. She grew up on picturesque English country estates with her elder sister, Parthenope.
Her upper middle class upbringing included an extensive home education from Florence’s father, who taught his daughters classics, philosophy and modern languages. Florence excelled in mathematics and science. Her love of recording and organising information was clear from an early age – she documented her extensive shell collection with precisely drawn tables and lists.
The Nightingales took their daughters on a tour of Europe, a custom intended to educate and refine gentlewomen in the 19th century.
But Florence's unconventional character continued to develop, as entries from her diary of the trip show. She recorded detailed notes of population statistics, hospitals and other charitable institutions. In spite of her mother's disapproval, she later received further tuition in mathematics. Yet her biggest rebellion was still to come. In 1837, she became convinced God had 'called' her to his service but her parents were horrified when she revealed what she thought the service should be.",B2
"Drop me a line! 

In our fast world of phones, fax machines and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet, to me, there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. 
Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother, also, always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. 
When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a 
week, and so would my mother. Occasionally my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls but it is the letters I remember most. 
There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. 
Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice and she has stayed with us. 
My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer, when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. 
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organised by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 
'lost art'. ",B2
"The Queen was frantic with worry after her son and heir Edward fell ill with typhoid.
It came a year after the founding of the French Third Republic, which had provoked anti-monarchist feeling in Britain. When Edward recovered, the Queen used a carefully orchestrated event to boost royal support. She gave a public thanksgiving service and appeared to crowds on the Buckingham Palace balcony. It marked the queen's gradual return to public life.
The Queen who became an Empress.
Victoria became the Empress of India to tie the monarchy and Empire closer together.
She accepted the title on the advice of her seventh prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, whose political advice she relied on. She approved of his imperialist policies, which established Britain as the most powerful nation in the world. Her popularity in Britain soared as she became a symbol of empire towards the end of her reign.
The Queen received Indian servants to mark her Golden Jubilee year. She promoted one, Abdul Karim, to become her personal teacher or ‘Munshi’.
Karim instructed Victoria in Urdu and Indian affairs and introduced her to curry. He was just 24 but Victoria was fascinated by India, the country she ruled but would never visit. Politicians and members of the royal household resented his position but despite this, Victoria gave him honours and lands in India and took him with her on visits to the French Riviera.",B2
"A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. In this article we consider the move to a second job. We are not concerned with those looking for a second temporary position while hunting for a permanent job. Nor are we concerned with those leaving an unsatisfactory job within the first few weeks. Instead, we will be dealing with those of you taking a real step on the career ladder, choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions now that you have learnt your way around, acquired some skills and have some idea of where you want to go. 
What sort of job should you look for? Much depends on your long-term aim. You need to ask yourself whether you want to specialise in a particular field, work your way up to higher levels of responsibility or out of your current employment into a broader field. 
Whatever you decide, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. 
This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious [line 26: beginning] career planning. Most important, it should [line 26: end] extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility. Incidentally, if the travel bug is biting, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see [line 34: beginning] that you have got it out of your system, and [line 34: end] are not likely to go off again.

"Issue: You must determine your position on a bill to amend the state constitution to reduce the voting age for state and local elections from age 18 to age 16. 
Merits of the case: The major reason advanced for the 16-year-old vote is that it would increase the likelihood that young people would “learn” to vote and get in the habit of voting. If their first eligible vote occurred when they were sophomores or juniors in high school, they could be taught more about voting in civics or government courses they took in the tenth grade. The opposition is based on the belief that 16-year-olds are not mature or responsible enough to be entrusted with this important right. 
Interest groups: The National Student Association supports the proposal, but no significant groups have come out in opposition. 
Political parties: Neither the Democratic nor the Republican party in the legislature has taken a position on this issue. 
Constituents: Relatively few constituents have contacted you on the issue. Most of those who have gotten in touch oppose voting by 16-year-olds. The overwhelming majority of your constituents are not at all concerned about the issue. On the other hand, several high school classes have sent you petitions favoring the proposal.

"Behind the dolphin's smile

People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas, films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. 

Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. They are among the most intelligent animals we know, they are sensitive to human emotions, and they allow us to dream of wonderful freedom out in the wild seas. 
This love affair has been encouraged by TV. First there was Flipper, and now there's Darwin, the star of Seaquest. However, these happy portrayals hide the reality of life for dolphins in the polluted and overfished seas of the 
late twentieth century. The population of North Sea harbour porpoises (one kind of dolphin) is estimated to have been reduced by up to 89,000. You may expect such popular animals to be protected by law and taken care of in special marine reserves. This is not the case, however, and the lack of plans to look after them may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our times. 
Forty different kinds of dolphins are recognised worldwide. In the waters of northern Europe, the greatest number of dolphins are the striped, the common, the bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two generally live far out in the open sea. They are normally seen only in small groups, flashing quickly past ships, and we know very little about them. 
The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises, on the other hand, were once a common sight near to European coasts. Bottlenoses are particularly social and used to be found on the Channel coast and in river mouths in Britain, including the Thames. Resident populations can nowadays be found only in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the skin injuries found on the few that still remain indicate that they are suffering from stress. 
The complicated habits of the dolphins make it difficult to decide on the exact reasons for this reduction in numbers. The overfishing which is dramatically reducing the world's fish stocks and which is threatening to destroy local fishing industries, also threatens porpoises and dolphins. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. 
They are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them. In many modern fishing methods, huge nets are left to float or are pulled at great speed through the sea. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have been washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks, ropes and cuts on their bodies show that the main cause of death was the fact that they had been caught by such nets. 
Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies. The females then produce milk that is rich in pesticides, thus passing the poison in a concentrated fashion on to their young. There is already one recorded case of a young dolphin being poisoned and killed by its mother's milk. 
But perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is the one posed by human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet 
understand. ",B2
"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The sons are composers and prize-winning musicians, while Dad makes the instruments. Matthew Rye reports.
Whole families of musicians are not exactly rare. However, it is unusual to come across one that includes not only writers and performers of music, but also an instrument maker.
When South Wales schoolteachers John and Hetty Watkins needed to get their ten-year-old son, Paul, a cello to suit his blossoming talents, they baulked at the costs involved. 'We had a look at various dealers and it was obvious it was going to be very expensive,' John says.
'So I wondered if I could actually make one. I discovered that the Welsh School of Instrument Making was not far from where I lived, and I went along for evening classes once a week for about three years.'
'After probably three or four goes with violins and violas, he had a crack at his first cello,' Paul, now 28, adds. 'It turned out really well. He made me another one a bit later, when he'd got the hang of it. And that's the one I used right up until a few months ago.' John has since retired as a teacher to work as a full-time craftsman, and makes up to a dozen violins a year - selling one to the esteemed American player Jaime Laredo was 'the icing on the cake'. Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from an early age. The piano came first: 'As soon as I was big enough to climb up and bang the keys, that's what I did,' Paul remembers. But it wasn't long before the cello beckoned. 'My folks were really quite keen for me to take up the violin, because Dad, who played the viola, used to play chamber music with his mates and they needed another violin to make up a string trio.
I learned it for about six weeks but didn't take to it. But I really took to the character who played the cello in Dad's group. I thought he was a very cool guy when I was six or seven. So he said he'd give me some lessons, and that really started it all off. Later, they suggested that my brother play the violin too, but he would have none of it.'
'My parents were both supportive and relaxed,' Huw says. 'I don't think I would have responded very well to being pushed. And, rather than feeling threatened by Paul's success, I found that I had something to aspire to.' Now 22, he is beginning to make his own mark as a pianist and composer.
Meanwhile, John Watkins' cello has done his elder son proud. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. Then, at the remarkably youthful age of 20, he was appointed principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held, still playing his father's instrument, until last year. Now, however, he has acquired a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 'Dad's not said anything about me moving on, though recently he had the chance to run a bow across the strings of each in turn and had to admit that my new one is quite nice! I think the only thing Dad's doesn't have - and may acquire after about 50-100 years - is the power to project right to the back of large concert halls. It will get richer with age, like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.' 
Soon he will be seen on television playing the Rugeri as the soloist in Elgar's Cello Concerto, which forms the heart of the second programme in the new series, Masterworks. 'The well-known performance history doesn't affect the way I play the work,' he says. 'I'm always going to do it my way.' But Paul won't be able to watch himself on television - the same night he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival. Nor will Huw,whose String Quartet is receiving its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall the same evening. John and Hetty will have to be diplomatic - and energetic - if they are to keep track of all their sons' musical activities over the coming weeks.",B2
"The Law Society of Scotland had strongly resisted government attempts to make the changes retrospective.
But the former judge Lord McCluskey argued it would improve Scots law.
Helen Scott's father, Morain, has described the double jeopardy law as her ""legacy.""
Scotland's senior prosecutor, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC and his predecessor Dame Elish Angiolini pushed for the new law in the aftermath of Sinclair's 2007 acquittal.
Mr Mulholland said: ""There's double jeopardy legislation in Ireland, some of the states in Australia, so I really think it was a modernisation of Scots Law.
""But the case against Angus Sinclair in 2007 was certainly taken into account by the parliamentarians when they passed this legislation.""
But retired detective superintendent Allan Jones, who was involved in the World's End case for 35 years, was more forthright.
""It's righted a wrong,"" he said.
""In 2007 justice wasn't done. Double jeopardy gave us the opportunity to revisit the case using new evidence and again do what should have been done at the time, and find these people guilty of that horrific crime back in 1977.""
Reacting to Sinclair's conviction, Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: ""This case came to court after the Scottish government brought forward the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act, which was unanimously passed by parliament.
""Double jeopardy is a centuries old principle of Scots law which prevents a person being tried twice for the same offence, but in this day and age, there should be no escape from justice.
""We have acted in the interests of Scottish justice, victims and their families and we hope this news brings some comfort to the families of the victims of these terrible crimes.""",B2

His example of non-violent protest is still revered throughout the world today. Find out how this man of peace and representative of India's poor came from a privileged background and spent his teenage years as a rebel.
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is born in north-west India in the princely state of Porbandar on 2 October 1869.

"The Empire of Mali was located in Western Africa. It grew up along the Niger River and eventually spread across 1,200 miles from the city of Gao to the Atlantic Ocean. It's northern border was just south of the Sahara Desert. It covered regions of the modern day African countries of Mali, Niger, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, and The Gambia. 

The Empire of Mali was established around 1235 CE. It began to lose power in the 1400s and fully collapsed in 1600 CE. The empire was formed when a ruler named Sundiata Keita united the tribes of the Malinke peoples. He then led them to overthrow the rule of the Soso. Over time, the Mali Empire became stronger and took over surrounding kingdoms including the Empire of Ghana. 

The government of the Mali Empire was led by the emperor who was called the Mansa. The empire was then divided up into provinces that were each led by a governor called a ferba. The religion of Islam played an important part in the government and many of the government administrators were Muslim scribes.

Although there were many small tribes and cultural groups within the Mali Empire, most of these groups were considered part of the Mande peoples. The Mande peoples spoke similar languages and had similar cultures. People were divided into castes. One of the most respected castes were the farmers. Farmers were highly regarded because they provided food. Just below the farmers were the artisans. Other groups included fishermen, scribes, civil servants, soldiers, and slaves. 

The religion of Islam was an important part of the Mali Empire. However, even though the kings, or Mansas, had converted to Islam, they did not force their subjects to convert. Many people practiced a version of Islam that combined Islamic beliefs with the local traditions.

"The endless talk of patient and doctor went on. Sometimes the doctor went through a whole hour without thinking at all, making automatic replies but not really hearing a word that was said to him. I wonder, he thought, whether I do these people any good at all. Perhaps they only want to talk, and need a listener.
He listened next to a dream. Almost all his patients told him their dreams, which annoyed the psychiatrist, who never remembered having a dream of his own. He listened to this dream, glancing now and then at his watch and wishing the hour would end. The dream, he knew, indicated a decreasing wish to live, a development of the death wish, and a desire for suicide that was prevented only by fear. But for how long?
Another dream. The psychiatrist closed his eyes and stopped listening. Five more minutes, he told himself, and then this fool would leave.
The doctor looked at the man, saw the heavy eyebrows, the expression of guilt and fear. 'I have to have my stomach pumped, Doctor,' the man said. 'Can you do it here or do we have to go to a hospital?'
'What's the matter with you?'
'Pills.'
'Sleeping pills? How many did you take?'
'Twenty,' said the man.
'Ten can kill you,' said the doctor. 'How long ago did you take them?'
'Half an hour. No, maybe twenty minutes.'
'And then you decided not to act like a fool, yes? Twenty minutes. Why wait this long?'
'I tried to make myself sick.'

"People often refer to natural selection as “the survival of the fittest.” With natural selection, the organism that is best adapted to its environment will be most likely to survive and produce offspring, thus spreading its genes to the next generation.The theory of evolution maintains that modern humans evolved from ape-like ancestors. The theory of plate tectonics is the most important theory in much of earth science. Plate tectonics explains why much geological activity happens where it does, why many natural resources are found where they are, and can be used to determine what was happening long ago in Earth's history. The theory of plate tectonics will be explored in detail in later concepts.
The theory of climate change is a much newer theory than the previous two. We know that average global temperatures are rising. We even know why: Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. In the atmosphere, greenhouse gases trap heat. This is like putting an extra blanket over Earth. Since more heat is being trapped, global temperature is rising. There is very little information that contradicts the theory that climate is changing due in large part to human activities. Unless some major discrepancy is discovered about how the atmosphere works, the theory is very likely to stand. So far, the evidence that is being collected supports the idea and global warming can be used to predict future events, which are already taking place.",B2
"A cash flow projection is one of the easier bookkeeping documents to build and maintain. There are no complicated accounting or tax principles involved. The only ingredients in a cash flow projection are how much cash you have, how much you plan to receive and how much you plan to spend.
A cash flow projection can be kept in any form that you find appropriate. However, an Excel spreadsheet is often the most convenient method. 
The first step in building the projection is to determine what time intervals you want to track. Most projections are done monthly, but you can use any interval you want. Quarterly is probably the longest length of time you'd want to track. If your cash flows are very unpredictable or if you are already in a cash crunch, you may want to tighten your time frame and keep track of cash flow on a weekly basis.
Let's assume we are going to project our cash flows for the upcoming year using monthly intervals. We would enter all 12 months along the top row of our spreadsheet. In the first column, we'd break down our main categories: opening balance, revenue, expenses and ending balance.
Starting with January, we would enter the opening balance of our cash-on-hand. This may be cash in any bank accounts and cash physically held at your business. We would then list and add in all expected revenues for the month of January. By adding revenues to our opening cash balance, we come up with the total amount of cash available to use in January.",B2
"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE 

When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground, flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. The careful planning and hard work of one man, supported unfailingly by his wife, turned this piece of ground into the masterpiece you see today. 
Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved during the construction of the village to change a flat site into the sculptured landscape you see today. Although bulldozers and digging machines helped to transform the land, it also involved an enormous amount of hard labour. Once shaped, approximately 1,000 tonnes of top soil were brought in and laid over it to create the lawns, flower-beds and rockeries. 
In the creation of the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These had to be carefully selected for the area. Only those plants which were able to tolerate the salt-laden atmosphere so close to the sea could be used. They also had to stand up to the severe winter gales in this very exposed position. Most of the plants were provided by local garden centres but some came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand. 
The whole village was conceived by Colin Sims and the models, over 100, were individually made by him over a period of nine years from when the village was first opened, in 1972. The models are constructed from a variety of materials - stone, concrete, specially treated wood and plastics - to withstand all kinds of weather. Initially, Colin had to seek considerable assistance from experts who explained to him how various materials would stand up to years of changing weather. But very soon he became an expert himself.
You will soon notice that a constant scale has been strictly adhered to and that attention has been paid to even the smallest detail on the models. This has been achieved by patience and the development of unique construction techniques. The Model Village has proved to be a very popular attraction and is noted for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used to construct such true-to-life models have since been used in other model villages around England and have even been included in some courses at colleges where modelling can be studied. 
All model buildings you will see in the village portray traditional British architectural forms and are not based strictly on one particular place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. This is a typical 13th century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls. It is based on the style of manor houses commonly found in the West Country. As you walk round the village you will also notice the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo and mini golf course, the latter being the most recent addition to the village.
We ask you to keep to the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; a slip on your part can result in hours of repair work for us. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. To further your enjoyment of the Model Village, you will see buttons mounted in front of some of the working models. Press these and you will make the models operate. 
At the end of your visit we would welcome any comments you might have. New models are being planned all the time and any new ideas will help us design a more varied and interesting display. We would also like to know which models, if any, you thought were not up to the standard of the rest of the village. We are continually replacing and updating the models and we need to know which ones require some attention. We hope you enjoy your visit and we look forward to seeing you another day. Don't forget to tell your friends about it. ",B2
"The Queen became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia and New Zealand.
In 1970 she invented the royal 'walkabout', to meet local people as well as dignitaries on her tours. This has since become a popular royal tradition. She is head of the Commonwealth, a title created by her father as countries left the Empire but wished to retain links with the UK and the monarchy. The Queen has visited all 53 Commonwealth nations except two recent joiners, Cameroon and Rwanda.
Britain was rocked by riots and unrest but at the same time celebrated with thousands of parties for the Queen's jubilee.
The country was suffering political turmoil, with an unpopular government, and many suffering economic hardship. During the Jubilee celebrations the Sex Pistols climbed the charts with the anti-monarchist God Save The Queen and were arrested after performing it on a boat on the Thames. Yet the Queen remained largely untouched by this outbreak of anger against the government and the state of the country. She still walked amongst admiring crowds.
A man fired six shots at the Queen while she was riding down The Mall. The shots turned out to be blanks.
Though shaken, the Queen retained control over her horse. The man, Marcus Serjeant, was tried and sentenced to five years in prison under the treason act. This attack came the month before Charles and Diana's wedding, so royal security was stepped up in preparation. The following year, another man broke into the Queen's bedroom in a startling breach of security at Buckingham Palace.",B2
"The trial of Angus Sinclair was the first to be held in Scotland following the ending of the centuries-old double jeopardy rule. This had prevented a person from being brought before the courts for a second time on the same charge after being acquitted.
Double jeopardy is a widely-held legal principal, and forms part of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
But a number of countries allow some exceptions to this general rule.
Scotland joined this group in 2011 when MSPs passed the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act - legislation which was first used in the World's End murder case.
Angus Sinclair had been tried in 2007 for the murder and rape of Helen Scott and Christine Eadie but was acquitted after the judge ruled there was no case to answer.
The prosecutor at the High Court in Edinburgh had failed to put vital forensic evidence before the jury.
As with the other home nations, Scotland sets significant tests for the prosecution to overcome before an accused person who has been acquitted can be tried for the second time.
These include the discovery of new evidence which was not available to the original trial.
Only serious cases such as murder and rape are subject to the new provisions.
As the Scottish Act was passed, Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said it would mean prosecutors no longer had their hands tied as they tried to ensure there was no escape from justice.
He said: ""The principle of double jeopardy dates back over 800 years but we now live in a very different world.
""The law needed to be modernised to ensure that it is fit for the 21st century and I am delighted that MSPs from all sides have voted in favour of these important changes.""",B2
"Growing up in Los Angeles, Vanessa Van Petten got into trouble so often that her mother and father began buying parenting advice books. 
During one of her frequent groundings, Van Petten glanced through several of the books and spotted what she considered two major problems. 
First, the books provided useless advice. More importantly, they were written by adults with no input from teenagers. That's when Van Petten decided to take matters into her own hands. 
At the age of sixteen, she wrote a book for parents from the teenage perspective: You're Grounded: How to Stop Fighting and Make the Teenage Years Easier. 
By the age of twenty-one, she had created RadicalParenting.com, an online community for parents and teens. That's where, with two full-time employees, Van Petten's 120 bloggers aged twelve to twenty answer questions from parents. The site generates revenue through advertising and sponsored links to other websites. 
Vanessa's advice: 
Get advice and help: 'Everyone said I was too young to start a company but I used online resources, read books, attended conferences and got advice from people I know. That's how I learnt about the business so quickly.' 
Reach new audiences: 'Social media is a great way to get in touch with new users - that's why we went on sites for mums and personally emailed videos to big users in each community.' 
Do something that works: 'Most importantly, we offered advice that actually works. Parents increasingly began spreading our quirky and sometimes controversial articles by word of mouth. We want to build a brand that is not only interesting but also life-changing.'

"We are literally drowning in news. Have you ever tried reading the whole newspaper, including the financial and sports pages? 
Or have you followed every piece of news on the front page of a news website? It's practically impossible. Reuters alone puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source. And how many of these stories are actually going to matter twenty years from now? 
You probably remember following the news about Michael Jackson's death or Prince William's wedding but will these stories make any difference for the future? Will they change our lives? 
We're probably going to forget watching the last Olympics sooner than we think. Maybe we should stop to think about which news is really important so that in the future we don't regret wasting our time on trivial things. 
But the amount of news is not the only problem. Unfortunately, the view of the world we get from the media is seriously distorted. Most of the news we get is local - the accident of a minor celebrity or a local society scandal is covered more extensively than important international news. 
Try to find out what's going on in other parts of the world - it's not easy. English-speaking networks often 'forget' to report news related to other parts of the world than their own. In the USA, the coverage of Russia, China and India together is one percent of the total news. 
The main reason for this is that covering your local Britney Spears or Paris Hilton is cheaper. And also, people love trashy gossip. I regret to say I'm a fan myself!

"Steve Jobs met engineering student Steve Wozniak through a mutual friend. Jobs was surprised to find Wozniak “knew more about electronics than I did.”
Their first joint venture was building devices that enabled people to make illegal free calls. Wozniak later said it was a “bad idea” to sell them, but it gave the duo “a taste of what we could do with my engineering skills and Jobs’ vision.” They then worked on a game for Atari, where Jobs convinced Wozniak to work round the clock to produce the game in four days – something Wozniak considered to be impossible. Jobs was paid a bonus for delivering on time that he kept secret from Wozniak.
Steve Jobs insisted on attending Reed College, Oregon, an expensive liberal arts university, despite his parents telling him they couldn’t afford it.
However, he soon dropped out. He had an on-off relationship with Chrisann Brennan and lived in a cabin in Los Gatos, California. His passion for good design led him to drop into a calligraphy class back at Reed which later inspired him to include a selection of fonts on his computers. He visited India, shaved his head and wore traditional Indian clothes. Eastern philosophy influenced him. He said: “I saw the craziness of the Western world as well as its capacity for rational thought.”
Jobs and Wozniak formed Apple Computer and built their first machine, the Apple I. It was sold without a case, screen, power supply or keyboard.",B2
"At the outbreak of World War One, life for Britain’s women was mainly tied to a life of domesticity, their places still largely in the home. Some, like the Suffragettes, were campaigning vocally for change, but the glass ceiling remained at ground level. Now, as Britain's men headed abroad to fight, women took their place en masse in factories, shops and offices across the country. And everything had the potential to change.
What was life like for the hard-working women who kept wartime Britain going? And, having proved they were a match for the demands of the wartime economy, were their efforts rewarded with better rights and greater freedom when peace returned?
To fill the gap left by a generation of fighting men, more than a million women took the chance to join the workforce between 1914 and 1918. They worked across the economy - from tram drivers and train cleaners, to postal workers and police patrols.
The wartime woman worker producing munitions for the front is among the most familiar visual legacies of the war. But conditions were poor and the work was arduous. 
Although figures were suppressed to keep morale high, accidents were common. An explosion at a TNT plant in Silvertown, East London, cost 73 people their lives and destroyed hundreds of nearby homes in January 1917.
Dangerous chemicals caused health problems that would outlast the war itself. TNT, for instance, turned thousands of workers' skin yellow – the so-called 'canaries' of the arms factories.
Though women often earned more than they had before the war, workers in munitions factories were still paid as little as half the wages of the men doing similar jobs.",B2
"Buckley's four o'clock press conference did not come on the early evening news. Jake laughed when first the national TV channels and then Memphis, then Jackson, then Ripelo, ended their broadcasts with no news about the Hailey trial, and no pictures of Buckley on the screen.
At ten, Jake and his wife Carla lay in the dark on the sofa, waiting for the news. Finally, there was Buckley, on the front steps, waving papers and shouting while the reporter explained that this was Rufus Buckley, the man who would prosecute Carl Lee Hailey. The camera was pointed at Buckley for a few seconds, and then the camera moved around the town square to give a wonderful view of the center of Clanton. It finally came back to the reporter for two sentences about a trial in late summer.
""Buckley's really horrible,"" Carla said, and turned off the sound of the TV. ""You know what I dislike most about your murder trials?""
She kicked the cushions off the sofa with her thin, brown, almost perfect legs.
""The blood, the pain?""
""No."" She let her shoulder-length hair fall around her as she fell back on the sofa.
""The loss of life?""
""No.""
She was wearing one of his old shirts. She began to play with the buttons.
""The horrible possibility of an innocent man facing the electric chair?""
""No.""
She unbuttoned the shirt. The blue television screen was the only light in the room. It was enough for Jake to see her almost perfect arms reach out for him.

"I was dirty, smelly, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't deal with any more foreign timetables, currencies or languages. 
'Never again,' I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and, because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learnt to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep.
Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too [line 10: beginning] anti-social, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life line 10: end] is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. 
Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen camp-site in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. 
We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organising our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money and music. 
The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the [line 29: beginning] station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. [line 29: end]
Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. 
While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognise this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately. ",B2
"Miss Rita Cohen, a tiny, pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be some six years older, came to his facto1y one day. She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes, and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She was so tiny, so young that he could barely believe that she was at the University of Pennsylvania, doing research into the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
Three or four times a year someone either phoned Seymour or wrote to him to ask permission to see his factory, and occasionally he would assist a student by answering questions over the phone or, if the student struck him as especially serious, by offering a brief tour.
Rita Cohen was nearly as small, he thought, as the children from Marie's third-year class, who'd been brought the 50 kilometres from their rural schoolhouse one day, all those years ago, so that Marie's daddy could show them how he made gloves, show them especially Marie's favourite spot, the laying-off table, where, at the end of the process, the men shaped and pressed each and every glove by pulling it carefully down over steam-heated brass hands. The hands were dangerously hot and they were shiny and they stuck straight up from the table in a row, thin-looking, like hands that had been flattened. As a little girl, Marie was captivated by their strangeness and called them the 'pancake hands'.
He heard Rita asking, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'How many? Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She continued taking notes as she asked, 'They come direct to your shipping department?'
He liked finding that she was interested in eve1y last detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material and they make it into the right kind of weather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery right here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started working in the business. Ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you've got to go to a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I'll set that up for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. The technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't that different from what you'd have seen hundreds of years ago. Awful work. It's said to be the oldest industry of which remains have been found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old relics of tanning found somewhere Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins that were tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather scholar; he's the one you should be talking to. Start my father off about gloves and he'll talk for two days. That's typical, by the way: glovemen love the trade and everything about it. Tell me, have you ever seen anything being manufactured, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'Saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.'
He laughed. She had made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was easily 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where she was dark, but othenwise Rita Cohen had begun to remind him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that would just waft out of her and into the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned in class. How she remembered everything. Everything neatly taken down in her notebook and memorised overnight.
'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to bring you right through the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'",B2
"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees from the woods were turned into boards for construction work, there was an old brick building two floors high, and all around the outside walls were heaped great piles of soft sawdust. There were many of these golden mountains of dust covering that part of the yard right down to the blue lake. That afternoon, bored with having nothing else to do, all the fellows followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building and they sat with their legs hanging over the edge looking out across the lake. Suddenly Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and without thinking about it, he pushed himself off the roof and fell on the sawdust where he lay rolling around and laughing. 'I dare you all!' he shouted. 'You're all cowards,' he said, encouraging them to follow him. Still laughing, he watched them looking down from the roof, white-faced and hesitant, and then one by one they jumped and got up grinning with relief. 
In the hot afternoon sunlight they all lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes till at last one of the fellows said, 'Come on up on the old roof again and jump down.'There wasn't much enthusiasm among them, but they all went up to the roof again and began to jump off in a determimed desperate way till only Michael was left and the others were all down below grinning up at him calling, 'Come on, Mike. What's the matter with you?' Michael wanted to jump down there and be with them, but he remained on the edge of the roof, wetting his lips, with a silly grin on his face, wondering why it had not seemed such a long drop the first time. For a while they thought he was only fooling them, but then they saw him clenching his fists tight. He was trying to count to ten and then jump, and when that failed, he tried to take a long breath and close his eyes. In a while the fellows began to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting and it was getting on to dinnertime. 'Come on, you're a coward, do you think we're going to sit here all night?' they began to shout, and when he did not move they began to get up and walk away, still shouting. 'Who did this in the first place? What's the matter with you all?' he called. 
But for a long time he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily and steadily at the ground. He remained all alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a great orange ball getting bigger and bigger, rolled slowly over the grey line beyond the lake. His clothes , were wet from nervous sweating. At last he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the pile of sawdust and lay there a long time. There were no sounds in the yard, the workmen had gone home. As he lay there he wondered why he had been unable to jump and then he got up slowly and walked home feeling deeply ashamed and wanting to avoid everybody. 
He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said to him coldly, 'You're big enough by this time surely to be able to get home in time for dinner. But if you won't come home, you’d better try staying in tonight.' She was a well-built woman with a fair, soft skin and a little touch of grey in her hair and an eternally patient smile on her face. She was speaking now with a controlled severity, but Michael, with his dark face gloomy and miserable, hardly heard her; he was still seeing the row of grinning faces down below on the sawdust pile and hearing them laugh at him.

'What are you thinking about? Can I ask?'

"Interview Tips

First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' 
As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.'
Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' 
Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. 
It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' 
Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' 
Businessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points.' ",B2
"Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art 

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. [line 6: end]
The mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer and worship, is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti. 
Jean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, 'People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.' 
He describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs. 
'When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture: he said. 'The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.' 
Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings,or even their names, in the rocks. 
But experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings.Henry de Lumley,director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says,not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced. 
Clottes disagrees. 'The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,’ he said. 'The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.’
David Lavergne,the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. 'Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,’ he said. 'Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.’ 
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach - tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles - the damage will increase rapidly.She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides.'You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money: she said. 'That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation.’",B2
"World War One proved that women could do the work of men – and do it just as well. Millions challenged the prejudices and conventions of the age by going into heavy industry, into offices or into jobs in transport, often leaving domestic service. But success was short-lived – and trumped by the needs of the returning troops at the war’s end. Adventurous, independent-minded women found themselves at odds with the mood. They found themselves thrown out of work and back into the kitchen almost overnight. It took another war in 1939 for them to return to the work place in such great numbers. In 1918, those women who managed to stay in their jobs were still being paid less for doing the same as men but it was a start. A new law in 1918 granted the vote to women over thirty – a partial victory, for it excluded most of the working-class women who had laboured in the engineering and the munitions factories. A handful of women were elected to parliament, more professions were opened up, and eventually the vote was granted to all in 1928. And the war changed how women looked – trousers appeared for the first time, corsets declined in popularity – and the ‘bob’ saw short hair become the fashion. The traditionalists were outraged and disgusted, but times had changed radically, though not enough to let women continue in their wartime roles, seen as temporary, only for the duration. Their achievements were overshadowed by the grim cost of the war. In reality, there was no going back. Women had proved what they could do; the war could not have been won without them.",B2
"This lesson consists of five scenarios and a debriefing discussion. The time allotted to the entire lesson is three 45-minute periods. 
Before the first period, Student Handout A should be distributed. It includes the same text that is presented earlier in the “Rationale” section of this lesson for teachers and briefly discusses the principal factors that ordinarily influence legislative decision making. The handout should be studied at home before students respond to the first set of scenarios. 
The first period should take up three scenarios in which students determine how most legislators would have voted and why. Student Handout B consists of brief instructions to the students and the five issues legislators have to decide. Student Handout B also contains a tally sheet that can be used to record students’ votes on how they think most legislators would decide on each issue. The second period should deal with the remaining two scenarios. 
Students should be given the instructions, along with the first three scenarios and the tally sheet. 
Deciding on an Increase in the Sales Tax; 
Deciding on Abolishing the Death Penalty; and 
Deciding on an Increased Cigarette Tax.
The students can discuss the issues as a class, but it is preferable that they be organized into discussion groups of six to eight. 
It should be emphasized that the purpose of group discussion is not to arrive at agreement, so there is no need for students to persuade one another of their view on how most legislators would vote. The purpose is to allow students to exchange views with and learn from one another. Each student should decide how legislators would vote on the basis of the factors specified in the scenarios, not on the basis of dominant opinion in the discussion group.",B2
"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people’s privacy and break the newspaper editors’ code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page. Yet very few call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. 
Rarely, if ever, are these pictures in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where, to quote the code of practice, ‘there is a reasonable expectation of privacy’, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn’t take any action. 
That the PCC did not launch an investigation itself is a scandal. It should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star’s love life. The pop star, like the famous actress, has held back from making a formal complaint. Shouldn’t the PCC [line 25: beginning] take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks? [line 25: end]
To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by their rivals and broadcast on TV and radio. The public would not be sympathetic and editors would have to refuse to publish such material. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. 
If the PCC decided to take on this role of ‘police officer’, which it technically could, there would be several problems. How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage him or her to make a complaint? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless? In addition, celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up, and then be outraged to find it wasn’t. Above all, the role itself is too enormous. How could the PCC realistically monitor the whole of the British press: national, regional and magazines? 
Then there is the embarrassment factor to consider. However seriously someone’s privacy has been invaded, would they really want the further embarrassment of an investigation? I suspect the majority simply want to put it behind them and get on with their lives. Of course, one or two may have other reasons for keeping quiet. A worse story may exist, that they have managed to keep from the press, and they realise that this may also become public knowledge if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. 
One British comedian also suffered at the hands of the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn’t complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again victims of a sneak photographer during a family holiday. His reason for this was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his ‘fury’, saying that they thought it was just a bit of fun, and that, being a film star who made comedies, they thought he had a sense of humour. This fear is understandable. People believe they will again become targets if they dare to challenge the tabloids. It is hard to see an easy solution to this serious problem. ",B2
"Living in the valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.
It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills.
Soon snow began to fall. Within a day it lay some 15 centimetres deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. Up there the wind blasted fiercely. Deep in our valley we felt only sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed but the branches held firm.
And yet we knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have occurred if circumstances had been different, if the flow of water from the hills had not, many years before, been controlled, held back by a series of dams.
In a short time the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched furious clouds pile up high over the hills to the west. Sinister grey clouds extended over the valleys. They twisted and turned, rising eastwards and upwards, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which every day was becoming fuller and wilder.
The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds, but high up in the hills the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. And then it happened - for the first time in years the reservoir overflowed. There in the heights it was like the Niagara Falls, as the water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. 
The river seemed maddened as the waters poured almost horizontally down to its lower stretches. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside.
On many occasions through the centuries before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in just such a rage. Now, though, the dam restricts the flow of the river and usually all is well; the great mass of water from the hills, the product of snow and torrential rain, remains behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley, and can be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.",B2
"We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people. Smaller children, apart from spending their own pocket money, can also influence what their parents buy, so many TV ads are created with kids in mind. 
For example, adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals. Then, as two-year-olds are being pushed around the shop by their parents in a trolley, they recognise the drink from the advert and ask the adults to buy it. As children grow older, some products are marketed to them as 'must-have' items, implying that children won't be liked by their friends if they don't get them. 
As a result, kids are desperate to get the product and parents can be made to feel guilty if they don't buy it for their child. Teenagers are incredibly critical of adverts, so products aimed at them have to be advertised much more cleverly. As teens are driven by the desire to be part of the 'coolest' group in their school, products need to be given a cool feel. 
For example, advertisers give away stickers which direct teens to a difficult-to-find website with more information about a product. In this way, naturally rebellious teens feel that they have been invited to an exclusive club and can be sold expensive products. 
As teens hate being influenced by adults, marketers let them persuade each other that a certain product is cool. Since the late nineties, 'street teams' of teenagers have been employed by clothing and record companies to spread the word about a product among young people.

"Ancient Rome was a powerful and important civilization that ruled much of Europe for nearly 1000 years. The culture of Ancient Rome was spread throughout Europe during its rule. As a result, Rome's culture still has an impact in the Western world today. The basis for much of Western culture comes from Ancient Rome, especially in areas such as government, engineering, architecture, language, and literature.

Rome first grew into power as a Republic. This meant that Rome's leaders, such as senators, were elected officials that served for a limited amount of time, not kings who were born into leadership and ruled for life. They had a complex government with written laws, a constitution, and a balance of powers. These concepts became very important in forming future democratic governments, like the United States. The Republic would rule Rome for hundreds of years from around 509 BC to 45 BC. 

In 45 BC Julius Caesar took over the Roman Republic and made himself the supreme dictator. This was the end of the republic. A few years later, in 27 BC, Caesar Augustus became the first Roman Emperor and this was the start of the Roman Empire. Much of the lower level government stayed the same, but now the Emperor had supreme power. 

As the Roman Empire grew it became more and more difficult to manage from the city of Rome. Eventually the Roman leaders decided to split Rome into two empires. One was the Western Roman Empire and was ruled out of the city of Rome. The other was the Eastern Roman Empire and was ruled out of Constantinople (today's Istanbul in Turkey). The Eastern Roman Empire would become known as Byzantium or the Byzantine Empire.

"Having long been a thorn in the side of the government, Mandela was finally arrested on charges of high treason in December 1956.
He went on trial with 155 other political leaders, including ANC colleagues Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo. The trial dragged on for nearly five years. Mandela often stayed in prison at night and worked in the day at his law firm. His marriage to Evelyn, meanwhile, was slowly disintegrating. Finally, in May 1961, along with all the other remaining defendants, he was acquitted. The judges ruled there wasn’t enough evidence to prove the defendants intended to overthrow the state by violence.
By 1958, his marriage to Evelyn had come to an end, and they divorced.
Later that year, Mandela married Nomzamo Winnie Madikizela, a social worker originally from a rural area of the Transkei. They first met when she visited the law firm in Johannesburg where he was working. He said the moment he saw her he knew he wanted her to be his wife. She quickly became an active member of the ANC and they went on to have two daughters.
In March 1960 there was worldwide revulsion when 69 black anti-apartheid demonstrators were killed by police in Sharpeville, south of Johannesburg.
The protest centred around the ‘pass laws’ which required identification to be carried by all black men and women, controlling their movement from one area to another. The government went on to declare a state of emergency and banned the ANC. Mandela knew that change was needed and was pivotal in convincing the ANC to drop the policy of non-violence. He helped establish its military wing – Spear of the Nation.",B2
"Let us suppose that the farmers have produced wheat on their lands using the three factors of production. The wheat is harvested and production is complete. What do the farmers do with the wheat? They retain a part of the wheat for the family’s consumption and sell the surplus wheat. Small farmers like Savita and Gobind’s sons have little surplus wheat because their total production is small and from this a substantial share is kept for their own family needs. 

Tejpal Singh, the large farmer, has a surplus of 350 quintals of wheat from all his lands! He sells the surplus wheat at the Raiganj market and has good earnings. 

What does Tejpal Singh do with his earnings? Last year, Tejpal Singh had put most of the money in his bank account. Later he used the savings for lending to farmers like Savita who were in need of a loan. He also used the savings to arrange for the working capital for farming in the next season. This year Tejpal Singh plans to use his earnings to buy another tractor. Another tractor would increase his fixed capital. 

Like Tejpal Singh, other large and medium farmers sell the surplus farm products. A part of the earnings is saved and kept for buying capital for the next season. Thus, they are able to arrange for the capital for farming from their own savings. Some farmers might also use the savings to buy cattle, trucks, or to set up shops. As we shall see, these constitute the capital for non-farm activities. 
We have learnt about farming as the main production activity in Palampur. We shall now take a look at some of the non-farm production activities.

"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain. 

Kendra Slowinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. 'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 
‘I’m too involved in what I'm doing - concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else. I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 
’I’m on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them.’ These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part. 'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.' 
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the 
opening ceremony.
'As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.' The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.’
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra. 
’But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.' Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing. 
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. ’As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.' 
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. ‘So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned. ’ Doubtless she will coach young players in the future, but at the moment her eyes are firmly set on her last big event. As she leads out her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is more than likely to have a tear in her eye.",B2
"In one of the first Bond novels, Ian Fleming tells us that James Bond - the classic “Englishman""? - was the son of a Scottish father and an Oriental mother. But perhaps this was not really true.
    The title of the 19th Bond film, “The World is Not Enough"", was based on the Latin motto of the Bond family, which is mentioned in one of the early novels. However, it now appears that the motto is not that of the Scottish Bonds, but that of a different Bond family, who came from the South West of England. So perhaps, Bond really is English, not Scottish, after all. Who knows?
    Bond went to school in England, anyway - to Eton College, the same school as his creator Ian Fleming. This is where Princes William and Harry were educated, and also many British Prime Ministers, including David Cameron! It is a school where young people learn how to move in high society, like Bond does so well.
    After leaving school, Bond did not go to university - it wasn’t necessary in the 1950’s...
    Oh? You didn’t know Bond was so old? He doesn’t look it, granted, but he is! Like a few other famous people, he seems to have found the secret of eternal middle age (we can’t call it “eternal youth"", can we?).
    Bond joined the British Secret Service, where he soon got promoted to the top of the spyrarchy, the “double O"" category. From then on he was 007, “licensed to kill"", and so began a career which would take him to all the corners of the earth.
    In the early days, Bond’s role was quite clear. He was working for the West, and his main enemies were men from the KGB, and other dangerous organisations.

"We often hear on radio and television news about the Dow Jones and NASDAQ indexes. What are these? NASDAQ is the world’s largest electronic stock market, trading shares of companies in many different industries, including technology, retail, financial services, communications and biotechnology. In 1896, Dow Jones & Company, a financial publisher, launched what is now known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It tracks the stock performance of thirty top U.S. companies, and is considered to be a barometer of the U.S. stock market. So when you hear that either the Dow or the NASDAQ is up or down, it means, in general, that a number of popular stocks are either going up or down in share price. 
If you’d like to invest in stocks, but you don’t have the time to study individual companies and their stock’s performance, there’s an alternative. It’s a mutual fund. When you buy into a mutual fund, you become an investor in many different companies. You become part of a group of people who put their money together and pay a professional investment manager to buy the stocks. As a result, you don’t have to watch the ups and downs of each stock; you just follow the overall value of the mutual fund. 
The idea behind a mutual fund is that it “spreads risk.” That means that if the fund invests in Company A, and its stock loses value, another company in the fund, Company B, may on the same day, increase in value. The gains in Company B may even cancel out the losses in Company A – so you might not lose anything. So, by spreading the risk, the mutual fund can help guard against losses.",B2
"Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen's appearance was as strange as his name. He was thin with the thin shoulders of a student and his face was extremely pale. His eyes were the eyes of a man who studies little things. They were always half-closed in concentration. Although he wore thick glasses you could see that his eyes were blue. But his strangest feature was his abnormally large forehead, on top of which sat a crown of yellow hair. Together all these things gave him a bizarre, almost grotesque personality.
Professor Van Dusen's family came from Germany. Many of his ancestors had been famous scientists; he was the logical result, the mastermind. And logic was his passion. He believed that two and two always equal four, except in unusual cases, when they may equal three or Five. He believed that all things that start must go somewhere, and he was able to concentrate all the mental force of his ancestors to solve any problem.
The public knew Van Dusen as The Thinking Machine and perhaps this phrase described him best of all. He spent all his time in his small laboratory where he invented brilliant theories that shocked scientists and had a profound effect on the world.
The Thinking Machine didn't have many visitors. When people did come to see him they were usually scientists. Two of these men, Dr Charles Ransome and Alfred Fielding visited him one evening to discuss some theory (what it was exactly is of no importance).

"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, Darwin described the process of natural selection. 
The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. They pass on these desirable characteristics to their offspring. Gradually those features become more common, causing the species to change over time. If the changes are great enough, they can produce an entirely new species. 
The Descent of Man, published in 1871, suggested that humans descended from apes. When Darwin studied medicine, he witnessed an operation performed on a child without anaesthetic. That made him give up medical studies. 
He then studied theology but, instead of becoming a priest, in 1831 he set off on a five-year scientific expedition around the world. There he collected evidence for his future theory. One of the key arguments for natural selection came from the birds that Darwin collected from the Gal pagos Islands. The birds were clearly the same species but some had large strong beaks for eating nuts while others had long thin beaks for finding worms in the ground. 
Darwin realised that all came from a single ancestor but, as they dispersed to different islands, they had adapted to eat the various foods available. Darwin developed the theory of evolution in the 1830s but he didn't announce it then. He knew his ideas were radical so he delayed publishing the theory for about twenty years while he assembled more evidence.

"Young Shoppers

Supermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar- coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff and, anyway, if I agree to their demands I feel I've been persuaded against my better judgement and I feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Yet I hate myself for saying no all the time, and I get cross and defensive in anticipation as we leave home. I do my best to avoid taking them shopping but then I worry that I'm not allowing them to have the experience they need in order to make their own choices. I can't win.'
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. More than £150 million a year is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. That figure is likely to increase and it is in the supermarket aisles that the investment is most likely to be successful. For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up the difference.",B2
"Favourite places

I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. Cycling was a release from school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, the sheltered valleys and old villages. Coming from Scotland myself, I found the landscape familiar yet different and I still go back there today. I used to describe my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, at which I subsequently made my name.

There is a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by amateurs. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep, and alongside a canal. But there is one point on the journey that I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers spy on people at random points in their day, making a cup of tea, doing the washing up, unfolding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields and sheep and a distant grey sea. That makes me look more closely, to search for something that opens my eyes.

The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and lovely coast. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks, so crowds are largely non-existent here. They attract a few brave surfers but most visitors prefer instead to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns and wild flowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who have some property in the village of Southole.

My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, or with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in an urban environment.

I purchased Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was a question of obtaining pure peace and reconnecting with my English roots and coming home. I grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway you'd never return.That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magic, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except sea, wind and birds.

"Trills and bills 

If there's one thing guaranteed to send tears running down your cheeks, it's the sight of a brilliant child collecting a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars, and their mothers, to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. 

A. 
Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. Her ambitions are to become a physiotherapist and compete at the next Olympics. 'The work is very hard at the moment. There is no time to watch television, or go out with friends or do much more than gym and school. I try to take the training day by day, and when I feel very, very tired sometimes my coach gives me a day off, but usually I just carry on - you can't take too many days off, it makes you stiff.' 

B.
Annika’s mother

'From an early age Annika showed tremendous potential. I've seen some parents try to push their children and it doesn't work. To perform at the level Annika does is so demanding of time and energy you have to want to do it yourself. People tell me all the time that we, as parents, have given up so much, but what they don't see is what the sport's given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before she did gym she was a very shy little girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me, but now she's met people from all over the world and she's got the confidence of success.' 

C. 
Sarah Stokes made her first show-jumping appearance at ten. Since then 
she has won the British National Championship. 'It's a good job my mum and dad like show-jumping because they train me and have to take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows are from one day to five days long. I don't ever get tired of it - I love show-jumping events, they are exciting and fun. Even if I didn't have Mum and Dad, I would do it because I am so determined. I'm 
glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My really big ambition is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.' 

D. Sarah’s mother

'From the moment Sarah sat on a horse, age 1, that was it, her passion. When she was 5, she used to get up before us all to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows you have to jump all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is well organised. She is 100% happy on a horse, she knows what she's doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is hard to beat.' 

E. Jane McShane, 10, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. 'It's really friendly at tournaments. I know everybody and it's fun. When I'm playing, I don't concentrate. I should do really, but instead I just stare around and don't bother to think. I'm not scared of getting big-headed, I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like embarrassment.' 

F. Jane’s mother

'Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, ""Let's see if she likes it."" My father had tried to teach me when I was young and I used to sit there bored, but Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that afternoon she had memorised all the moves, and by 6 was starting to beat adults. When she's won of course I'm pleased, but if she said she wanted to give it all up tomorrow, I wouldn't stand in her way. On the other hand I don't want to do the awful thing of putting somebody down because they are exceptional. If she has this gift, let her fulfil her potential.' ",B2
"I stopped the car in a cloud of dust, and we walked up the steps and into the saloon. 
Well if I'd wanted to do a bit of time-travelling, I couldn't have done much better; walking through that door was like walking back eighty years in time. Inside, the old Western saloon was still intact, with its big long wooden bar, and enormous mirrors on the walls. Apart from the electric light, the juke box, and the tables set for dinner, it was almost perfect. 
And there in the corner sat the prospector, with his wife. If he'd been wearing a red gown, I'd have taken him for Father Christmas, but he wasn't. This old-timer wasn't in Atlantic City to bring presents, but to find gold. 

He said his name was Brad, and he'd been looking for gold in Atlantic City for some time now. Yes, he'd found some too; not enough to make him a millionaire, but enough to make him happy. 
When the Gold Rush ended in Atlantic City, he told me, it was not actually because there was no more gold, but because gold was too hard to find, or not valuable enough. 
Today, gold is a lot more valuable than it was a hundred years ago, and modern techniques allow people to find gold more easily. And that was why Brad and his wife were in Atlantic City, digging for gold. 
They were not the only ones, said Brad; quite a few of the ""concessions"" are now being worked, and some old mines are being opened up again. In some places, mining for gold has become commercially profitable again; but in most cases, the miners, like Brad, are just amateurs.

"Trying to get published?

If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need.
Readers of this magazine often write in saying, 'I have written this story / book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should be researching their markets and finding out about publishers as well as practising their writing skills. Turning words into a saleable commodity takes a good deal of knowledge about the 'writing game'.
Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. There are several ways of doing this, but the best one is simply by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.
As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated as new publications are constantly appearing - editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always hungry for new blood; as writers we have to make sure we give them what they want.
To begin with you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let us say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The very first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, taking special note of who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in catering to their needs.
Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never actively discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is of publishable standard; so I have to try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint.
The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about so-called success', you usually find that the person has been in the publishing trade or journalism for some years before their current success.
When you do finally send off some of your work for the first time, immediately get on with more work while you await a reply; write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you will begin to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and your confidence will grow. Don't tear any of them up-improve them instead. Also, I would advise not showing your work to anyone else, certainly in the early stages.
Don’t forget that every successful writer will have had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See whether there’s a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group which will help you to gain ideas and confidence from mixing with other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and get that writing practice in - every day if possible.",B2
"Viking warriors were a fierce bunch, trained in archery, spear-throwing and swordplay from the age of 10. The most fanatical warriors were called “berserkers”. Inspired by the Viking god of war, Odin, these fighters worked themselves up into a battle rage that they believed gave them superhuman powers and made them invincible.
The word Viking means “raider"" or ""trader”. From the 8th to the 11th centuries these daring Scandinavian pirates carried out surprise attacks on the monasteries and towns of Britain and Europe. Some even voyaged as far as North Africa, Turkey and North America to seek out booty and rewards.
To join a Viking raiding party was to sign up for a life fraught with danger. Many died fighting or lost their lives in the perilous and stormy seas.
Viking battles began with one warrior throwing a spear over the enemy line dedicating the men's lives to the war god Odin. The warriors then attacked with a rain of spears and arrows, before engaging in hand-to-hand combat.
If you were a young warrior you would be first to attack, drawn up in line, with your shield overlapping in a 'shield-wall' for better protection. If you were a veteran warrior you would line up behind forming a bodyguard to defend your chief.
For many Viking warriors Thor was the primary god and role model. He was portrayed as a heroic battler who brandished a giant hammer which he used to smite his enemies.",B2
"The Red Death had killed thousands of people. No disease had ever been so terrible. There were sharp pains, and sudden fainting, and heavy bleeding through the skin; death came in half an hour. Red marks on the body, and especially on the face, separated the sufferer from all help and sympathy; and as soon as these signs appeared, all hope was lost.
But Prince Prospero was happy and brave and wise. When half his people had died, he called together a thousand of his lords and ladies, all cheerful and in good health, and with these he went to live in his most distant castle. The immense building, and its lands, were surrounded by a strong, high wall. This wall had gates of iron. The lords and their families, having entered, heated and melted the locks of the gates, and made sure that no key would ever open them again. 
The castle, which no one could now enter or leave, was well provided with food, and safe from the danger of disease. The world outside could take care of itself. Inside, it was foolish to worry, or to think. The prince had planned a life of pleasure. There were actors and musicians, there were beautiful things, there was wine. All these and safety were inside. Outside was the Red Death.
The court had been perhaps five or six months at the castle, and the disease had reached its height beyond the walls, when Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at an unusually grand masked dance.

"In the nineteen fifties, Britain was a nation in need of men. A decade after the second world war, it was a country with lots of children, but not enough men to work in the mines, the factories and the public services. 
     Hundreds of thousands of young men had been killed during the war; who could take their place? There was an easy answer; men from the colonies! Britain was still the capital of an Empire that stretched to the four corners of the earth. In the developing countries of the Commonwealth, there were millions of young men, just looking for work. When the British authorities offered them the chance to come to Britain and work, thousands wanted to come. 
     Most came without their families; but soon, as they settled into their new country and their new jobs, they paid for their families to come over too. While a few came from Africa, the largest contingent of Black immigrants came from Jamaica and the other islands that make up the West Indies.
      By 1960, ""Afro-Caribbeans"" and their families had settled in large numbers in several of Britain's cities — usually in the poorest and most unattractive parts. At the time however, the conditions they lived in in Britain were not too bad, and often better than those they had enjoyed in the West Indies. There were jobs, so there was money; there were schools for the children. 
     Thus, with its young families, but few teenagers, the Afro-Caribbean community lived quietly beside the White community in cities like London and Wolverhampton, and there was no tension. In reality, the two communities hardly mixed at all.

"In today’s modern democracy we are no longer subject to the rule of a King or Queen, as in the days of Magna Carta. But the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta reminds us of the duty and responsibility our government has to protect us, to secure our rights and to maintain the rule of law. These fundamental rights of freedom and liberty, it can be argued, can be traced all the way back to the original language of Magna Carta.
Previous generations had to fight our enemies in world wars to keep our freedom. Today, there are new everyday risks, many of which now exist online. Increasingly, the government must focus on reducing the threat from terrorists and criminal gangs, so that we can live our lives freely. The internet and social media offer huge opportunities for economic, social and educational advancement, but only if law enforcement is allowed to police the digital space to make it safe for us to enjoy.
If we want the advantages of the new digital world we must empower the authorities to police it on our behalf. The only way for them to do this, is to allow analysts in specialist agencies to access people’s communications online. We do this through laws that are democratically debated and passed. Like the barons in 1215, in return for our support, the authorities must live up to the promise of Magna Carta, including the right to live in peace and in privacy. However, we cannot demand absolute privacy if that means allowing the activities of terrorists and criminals to go undetected and unpunished.",B2
"Gary and Me

The restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef.
I believe everyone's given a chance in life. My son, Gary, was given his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I rushed over to look at the place. It was in a really bad state. It was perfect for what I had in mind.
Coming into this business made me recall my childhood. I can remember my mother going out to work in a factory and me being so upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We want time for family life.' My wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived over the restaurant in those days, and we always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. It's paid dividends with our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. Also, from a very early age they would come down and talk to our regular customers. It's given both of them a great start in life.
Gary was quite a lively child when he was really small. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven he thought he'd jump into it like a swimming pool, and he knocked himself out. When he was older he had to work for pocket money. He started off doing odd jobs and by the age of about ten he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had loads of money at school. He had discipline. He used to be up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out.
Gary wasn't very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. By the age of 15 he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair. So when he came to me and said, 'Dad, I've got to do work experience as part of my course at school,' I sent him to a friend of mine who's got a restaurant.
Gary recently took up playing the drums and now he has his own band. Goodness knows what will happen to the cooking if the music takes off. My advice to Gary would be: if you start chasing two hares, you end up catching neither, so chase the hare you know you're going to catch. He understood when I said to him: 'Gary, if you're going to get anywhere in life, you've got to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.'
Gary went to catering college at the age of 17, and on his first day he and the other new students -they're normally complete beginners - were given what's supposed to be a morning's work. But within an hour Gary had chopped all his vegetables, sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son for you! In the end, he was helping other people out.
None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you've got to work jolly hard for it, because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he's been given and grabbed hold of it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten per cent of what you've told them, you've got to be happy with that. The things Gary says, the things he does, I think, well, he must have listened sometimes.",B2
"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because 'it's fun'. 

Teenager with a taste for endurance 

WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). Ability to do all three without a rest essential. 

The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping. Great for those watching, maybe, but what makes the triathletes want to punish their bodies so much? And what makes an attractive 17-year-old, with excellent academic results, give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers? 
Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes automatically use when asked similar questions. 'You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 1Okm, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,' she says. 
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. 'I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went round.' Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. 'I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realised then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the running.' 
But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. 'Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be [line 35: beginning] tempted to do it again.' Such doggedness draws [line 35: end] admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. 'I've just been testing her fitness,' he says, 'and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realise they can't go any further, she just kept on.' 
Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a £2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. 
But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.' What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? 'No, what sort of times they are achieving.' 
Where will all this single-mindedness end? Melanie has tried other events. She has had a go at the triathlon 'sprint', for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. 'The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,' she says. Funny, that. ",B2
"Variations on a Theme

If you're thinking of taking children to a theme park, there are dozens to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to test the best.
Fun Island - The Burns family
Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. In fact, we were impressed. The park tries hard to cater for younger children, so our three-year-old didn't feel left out. The kids all loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's a special dodgems ride for the very young kids, which was a great success. For older children, there are scarier rides, such as Splash Out, where you end up jumping in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to call it a day, but the children objected because they were having such fun. Our only criticism would be that the park is slightly lacking in atmosphere, and the scenery leaves something to be desired. But the staff are extremely helpful and we felt it was clean, well organised and very security-conscious.
Wonderland - The McMillan family
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he adored it. He was in heaven on the Mountain Train, and particularly liked Little Land, with its small replicas of famous buildings that were at his level! The older children enjoyed the ferris wheel, and loved driving the toy cars on a proper road layout. We spent six hours there and were glad that there were places where you could put your feet up. The landscaping is perfect and the staff very helpful and friendly. And there's something for everyone, adults included.
Adventure World - The Jeffree family
After seven hours we felt there was still a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a fantastic trapeze act and kept us on the edge of our seats. We went on the Terror Line and, although the girls were rather scared and kept their eyes shut most of the time, they said they'd enjoyed it. Their favourite ride was Running River, where you think you're going to get soaked, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The children had a look at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we breathed a sigh of relief when they found that they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even queuing for rides isn't too boring. It's spotlessly clean, and the staff are great. On one ride I couldn't sit with both girls, so a member of staff offered to go with one of them.
The Great Park - The Langridge family
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a super theme park for younger children because the rides aren't too terrifying. I'm a real coward but even I enjoyed myself. We all adored Exotic Travels, a boat ride which starts off quite tamely and then becomes terrific fun. We queued for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over before we knew it! I wouldn't go on the Big Leap, but if you have the nerve, it looked great. If the children had been a little older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were all in the right age group and they loved it.
Fantasy World - The Break-all family
According to the park's advertising there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we certainly felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, dominates the skyline, and Ben thought it was the most terrifying of the rides, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres above the ground, was even worse! There are a dozen or so main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a couple of them, but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes were mixed. Some of them were great with the younger children, but the welcome wasn't always as warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared tell the kids we were going home early.

"Then his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships' lights shone. The moon in its first quarter hung over the hill to the west, and the stars were clear and bright. Five minutes later, Dr Kemp pulled down the window again, and returned to his writing desk.
It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell rang. He sat listening. He heard the servant go to the door, and waited for the sound of her feet on the staircase, but she did not come.
'What was that about?' Dr Kemp asked himself. He tried to go on with his work, failed, and went downstairs. He rang the bell and called to the servant as she appeared in the
hall.
'Was that a letter?' he asked.
'Only the bell ringing, sir, and no one there,' she answered.
'I'm restless tonight,' he said to himself. He went back to his study.
Soon afterwards he was hard at work again, and his room was silent except for the sounds of the clock and his pen moving over the paper.
It was two o'clock before he had finished his work for the night. He rose and went upstairs to bed. When he had taken off his coat and shirt, he felt thirsty. He took a lamp and went down to the dining room in search of a drink.
Dr Kemp's scientific work had trained him to notice things quickly. As he crossed the hall, he saw a dark spot on the floor near the stairs. He went on upstairs, and then he asked himself what the dark spot on the floor might be.

"As a child I had been impressed by the Boerum House. It was fairly new then, and shiny with new paint - a huge Victorian building. Standing in front of it this early Christmas Eve, however, I could find no echo of that youthful impression. It was all a depressing gray now, and the curtains behind the windows were drawn completely so that the house seemed to present blindly staring eyes to the passerby.
When I knocked my stick sharply on the door, Celia opened it. 'There is a doorbell,' she said.
She was still wearing the long unfashionable and badly wrinkled black dress which must have been her mother's, and she looked more than ever like old Katrin had in her later years: the thin bony body, the tight thin line of her lips, the colorless hair pulled back hard enough to remove every wrinkle from her forehead. She reminded me of a steel trap ready to shut down on anyone who touched her incautiously.
I said, 'I am aware that the doorbell is not connected, Celia,' and walked past her into the hall. She banged the door shut, and instantly we were in half-darkness.
I put out my hand for the light switch, but Celia said sharply, 'This is no time for lights! There's been a death in this house, you know that.'
'I have good reason to know,' I said, 'but your manner now does not impress me.'
'She was my brother's wife, and very dear to me.'
I moved towards her and rested my stick on her shoulder. 'Celia,' I said, 'as your family's lawyer, let me give you a word of advice. The inquest is over, and you've been cleared. But nobody believed you then, and nobody ever will. Remember that.'

"The ultimate betrayal
Boudica's story is one of transformation, from obedient citizen to the Roman Empire's deadliest enemy. Although we don't have any first-hand testimony, the accounts we do have were written by eminent Roman historians – Tacitus and Cassius Dio – both writing within a century of the events.
A friend of Rome
In the first century, Boudica married Prasutagus, king of the Iceni tribe and a good friend of the Romans. By the second half of the century, his kingdom was a client-state of Rome. In return for allegiance to the Emperor, the Iceni were allowed to live peacefully and in accordance with their native customs. This meant that Boudica and her family were in fact Roman citizens. 
Prasutagus dies
The Iceni were betrayed when Prasutagus died. In his will, the king split his kingdom between his daughters and the Emperor Nero but Britannia’s financial minister ignored this and heavily taxed the tribe and ordered soldiers to occupy Iceni land. The Iceni were treated as slaves. Boudica objected but, according to Tacitus, the Romans refused to listen – they flogged the queen in front of her people and raped her two daughters. 
The Celts rise up
Boudica could not allow such an affront to stand: she would teach the Romans a gruesome lesson. With the help of the Trinovantes, another tribe, she prepared to launch a campaign of blood-letting and butchery which would stretch across southern England.",B2
"Young Shoppers
Supermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar- coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff and, anyway, if I agree to their demands I feel I've been persuaded against my better judgement and I feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Yet I hate myself for saying no all the time, and I get cross and defensive in anticipation as we leave home. I do my best to avoid taking them shopping but then I worry that I'm not allowing them to have the experience they need in order to make their own choices. I can't win.'
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. More than £150 million a year is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. That figure is likely to increase and it is in the supermarket aisles that the investment is most likely to be successful. For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up the difference.",B2
"After decades of racial oppression and the jailing of ANC and other political leaders, South Africa was being rejected by the international community.
While Mandela was in jail, there were boycotts by musicians and cultural figures, including Dusty Springfield, who refused to play to segregated audiences. In 1970 the ‘Stop the Tour’ movement was launched, preventing white South African rugby players and cricketers from playing in test matches. The country had already been banned from the Olympics. In the mid 1970s, economic sanctions and policies of disinvestment followed. The trade in arms with the apartheid state was also prohibited.
Mandela’s prison conditions had begun to ease a little by the 1970s and he began to consider the possibility of political negotiation over violence.
Mandela studied Afrikaner history to understand his oppressors better, and encouraged other ANC prisoners to do so too. In 1976 he started to secretly write his autobiography. It was later published and called the Long Walk to Freedom. He was becoming a famous political prisoner, but few outside the prison knew what he looked like. In South Africa it was illegal to print photos of him. From around 1978 Mandela gradually became the focal point for the global campaign against apartheid.
As Mandela’s fame grew throughout the 1980s, pressure from internal and external forces to release him increased.
High profile events were held, such as Nelson Mandela’s 70th birthday concert in 1988, when artists including Stevie Wonder performed to a packed Wembley Stadium. Watched by 600 million viewers worldwide, it raised awareness of his imprisonment and the anti-apartheid struggle.",B2
"Couffignal is a two-hour ride from San Francisco. It is not a large island, and is joined to the mainland by a wooden bridge. Its western shore is a high, straight cliff that comes up out of Pablo Bay. From the top of the cliff the island slopes eastward to a beach, where there are piers and pleasure boats.
Couffignal's main street has the usual bank, hotel, movie theater and stores, but there are also trees and lawns, and no ugly flashing signs. The buildings seem to belong beside one another, as if they had been designed by the same person.
The streets that cross the main street run between rows of neat cottages near the bottom of the slope, but higher up the houses are larger and further apart. Most of the owners of these houses are rich, well-fed old men who will spend what is left of their lives nursing their health among their own kind. They admit to the island only as many storekeepers and working people as are needed to keep them comfortably served.
That is Couffignal.
It was some time after midnight. I was in an upstairs room in Couffignal's largest house, surrounded by wedding presents whose value would add up to something between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars. The ceremony had been performed in a little stone church down the hill. Then the house had begun to fill up with wedding guests, and had stayed filled until the bride and her new husband had gone off to catch their train.
A private detective at a wedding is supposed to look like any other guest, but this is never possible.

That's because of the nature of the EN-V. Last week, I drove one of these, though it was more like flying a small plane than driving. In terms of wackiness, originality, smiles per mile and fun at the controls (I can't say behind the wheel because I didn't find one, or any pedals come to that) it gets 11 out of 10 from this sceptical fan of electric vehicles. 
Sure, it's an effective mobility machine for one or two people travelling around cities. But it's far less like a car than the Renault Twizy which has four wheels and needs a fully-qualified car driver. 
When I asked the company last week, GM said it was unsure what legal category it will be in. I'd call it a 'Personal Urban Mobility Pod'. It's less than 60 inches in length, as wide as it is long, able to drive itself or be driven, has a 25 mph top speed, a range of 25 miles, and is supposed to be uncrashable thanks to its sensors. 
While they are doing homework en route, an insecure parent can watch thanks to the on-board CCTV facilities. Then, after delivering its human cargo, driving itself back home and parking itself neatly, it would be time for one or more of the parents to climb in for the morning commute to the office. 
After that, the EN-V can recharge its battery, a process that takes only two to six hours. 
GM insists that today's typical car, with its five seats and internal combustion engine, is 'inefficient' and 'over-engineered' for city driving, even if it is very green. A conventional car capable of doing 100 mph plus is underused and expensive for customers, millions of whom live in overcrowded cities with average speeds of 8-12 mph.

"Some people want an internet that is encrypted and anonymous, beyond the view of government. But, like all ungoverned spaces, it will inevitably become a safe haven for those who mean us harm. Here are some examples of when this has happened:
The internet is used by terrorists to meet and plan attacks. The nine individuals convicted of plotting to attack the London Stock Exchange and other targets in 2012 used internet forums to arrange meetings and stay in touch.
The internet is used for online child exploitation. In Bahrain in 2014, four men were imprisoned for a total of 20 years, following a UK investigation. The men targeted around 250 children, pretending to be young girls online in order to get young boys to send them indecent images.
In the UK, we have a sound legal framework that allows the police and the intelligence agencies to work together to uncover plots against us, using advanced digital tools. But in the spirit of Magna Carta, the authorities are strictly limited by laws that have been democratically passed:
To intercept the content of a message or internet conversation requires a warrant signed by a Secretary of State.
A Commissioner (a very senior retired judge) will also examine the lawfulness of the warrants and how they are used. Although digital communications can generate huge levels of ‘metadata’, UK law insists on a full warrant being obtained for anything beyond simple billing information.
Lastly, anyone has the right to complain to an independent court if they think they are the subject of unlawful interception.",B2
"In 1998, the world-class Moroccan athlete, Hicham El Guerrouj, broke the 1500-metres world record with a time of three minutes, twenty-six seconds. Nearly fifteen years later, nobody has beaten that time. Have we got to the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft, Professor of Physiology at Oxford University, explains the limits of the human body during a race.  
As the athlete moves forward, there is an immediate jump in the rate of breathing. The heart rate goes up rapidly to its maximum level and the haemoglobin in the red blood cells provides more oxygen to the muscles. 
A few seconds into the race, immediate energy stores are depleted, lactic acid begins to accumulate in the muscles and the athlete starts to run out of oxygen. The athlete's body becomes exhausted because he is unable to supply fuel and oxygen quickly enough. 
If the runner does not slow down, the heart rhythm becomes less regular, the oxygen content in the blood may fall and the temperature rises. The athlete becomes uncoordinated and is close to collapse. The key to performance is the rate at which energy - in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - can be generated to power muscle contraction. 
ATP must be replaced by the breakdown of carbohydrate or fat. Muscles contain a limited amount of carbohydrate which lasts for about an hour of exercise and oxygen is used to produce most of the ATP needed. As everyone knows, you breathe faster and more deeply when you run and the harder you exercise the quicker your breathing gets. What is clear, however, is that breathing does not limit exercise.

"Good Queen Bess'
Elizabeth I is one of England's greatest monarchs – perhaps the greatest. Her forces defeated the Spanish Armada and saved England from invasion, she reinstated Protestantism and forged an England that was a strong and independent nation.
But she had a very difficult childhood and was fortunate to make it to the throne at all. When she was young, her father Henry VIII executed her mother Anne Boleyn. She was stripped of her inheritance and was imprisoned in the Tower of London.
Elizabeth is born on 7 September in Greenwich Palace.
News of her birth causes rejoicing across the country, but is a bitter disappointment to her father Henry. He is desperate for a male heir to continue the Tudor dynasty. Although Elizabeth is made next in line to the throne, the King prays his next child will be male – superseding her claim to the throne.
Elizabeth is two years and eight months old when her mother Anne Boleyn is accused of adultery and beheaded on the orders of Henry VIII.
Her father marries Anne’s lady-in-waiting Jane Seymour a week later. Elizabeth is declared illegitimate and removed from the royal succession. Her title is downgraded from 'Princess’ to 'Lady’. Elizabeth is neglected for a number of years until Henry's final wife Catherine Parr takes charge and makes sure she is educated to the highest standards and, crucially, taught the art of public speaking by renowned Cambridge scholar Roger Ascham.",B2
"The cop saw the car stop on the bridge but didn't think too much about it. People often stopped their cars on the bridge late at night, when there was not much traffic. The bridge was over the deep river that cut the city neatly in two, and the center of the bridge provided the best view of the city.
Suicides liked the bridge, too. The cop didn't think of that until he saw the man get out of the car, walk slowly along the footpath at the edge, and put a hand on the rail. There was something about that lonely figure, something about the grayness of the night, the fog coming off the river. The cop looked at him and swore, and wondered if he could get to him in time.
He didn't want to shout or blow his whistle because he knew what surprise could do to a probable suicide. Then the man lit a cigarette, and the cop knew he had time. They always smoked all of that last cigarette before they went over the edge.
When the cop was within ten yards of him, the man turned, gave a slight jump, then nodded as if accepting that the moment had passed. He appeared to be in his middle thirties, tall with a long narrow face and thick black eyebrows.
'Looking at the city?' said the cop. 'I saw you here, and thought I'd come and have a talk with you. It can get lonely at this hour of the night.' He patted his pockets, pretending to look for his cigarettes and not finding them. 'Got a spare cigarette on you?' he asked.
The man gave him a cigarette and lit it for him. The cop thanked the man and looked out at the city.

"Listen, and I will tell you of the famous dark day in Connecticut. It
was in the month of May, more than a hundred years ago.

The sun rose bright and fair, and the morning was without a cloud. The
air was very still. There was not a breath of wind to stir the young
leaves on the trees.

Then, about the middle of the day, it began to grow dark. The sun was
hidden. A black cloud seemed to cover the earth.

The birds flew to their nests. The chickens went to roost. The cows
came home from the pasture and stood mooing at the gate. It grew so
dark that the people could not see their way along the streets.

Then everybody began to feel frightened. ""What is the matter? What is
going to happen?"" each one asked of another. The children cried. The
dogs howled. The women wept, and some of the men prayed.

""The end of the world has come!"" cried some; and they ran about in the
darkness.

""This is the last great day!"" cried others; and they knelt down and
waited.

In the old statehouse, the wise men of Connecticut were sitting. They
were men who made the laws, and much depended upon their wisdom.

When the darkness came, they too began to be alarmed. The gloom was
terrible.

""It is the day of the Lord."" said one.

""No use to make laws,"" said another, ""for they will never be needed.""

""I move that we adjourn,"" said a third.

Then up from his seat rose Abraham Davenport.

His voice was clear and strong, and all knew that he, at least, was
not afraid.

"The Victoria Cross was introduced by Queen Victoria to honour acts of great bravery during the Crimean War. It was awarded on merit instead of rank.
The Crimean War was fought by an alliance of countries including Britain against Russia. The Queen was suspected of secretly supporting the Russian Tsar. However, she allayed suspicions by taking an interest in the nursing of wounded soldiers. She also awarded the first Victoria Crosses personally to 62 men at a ceremony at Hyde Park in 1857. It was the first time officers and men had been decorated together.
A set of 14 photos, known as Carte de Visites, was created of the Royal Family.
More than 60,000 copies were sold, despite having a hefty price tag of four pounds and four shillings. It marked the beginning of photographic celebrity culture. Women tried to replicate Victoria's fashions while some men copied Albert's hairstyle and moustache.
Prince Albert died at the age of 42. The Queen was inconsolable with grief and wore mourning for the rest of her life.
Victoria withdrew from public life after Albert's death, but kept up with her correspondence and continued to give audiences to ministers and official visitors. She decreed that monuments to honour Albert should be built across the country and Empire – including the Albert Memorial. She became very close to John Brown, a servant at Balmoral Castle, even though her children resented him. Victoria was called ‘Mrs Brown’ in the press but despite this she refused to give up her friendship.",B2
"Ma's breath caught in her throat. Pa said softly, ""Did you kill him?""
""I don't know,"" Tom said. ""I hope so.""

""A fellow can't eat on that.""
""And then the pickers went on strike. And now the cops killed Casy.""
""Well, we need to get to work."" Ma looked sadly at Tom. ""Rosasharn will stay with you. We'll tell them that you're sick today.""
The family went to work. Tom finally fell asleep. His sister watched him and the door.
As the sun began to set, Ma came back to the house. She carefully built a fire in one end of the stove and filled a pot with water and put it over the flame.
""How was picking today?"" Tom asked.
Ma took a cup of dried corn pieces out of a bag. ""I don't want to talk about it,"" she said.

"In hot water 

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. 

Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean we can't stand up or move and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.' 
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. No-one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.’
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures; including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. 
The Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' 
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"". This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.’
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a SO-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. 
There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real it was such an amazing feeling.' ",B2
"Conduct becoming 

Giving directions to an orchestra is never easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work. 

A. ANNE MANSON 

When Anne Manson, 30, asked if she could attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna, she found herself standing in for an absent assistant. She was then asked to help on another opera the next season. 'I had to take the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I always had a good attitude to standing up in front of an orchestra.' American-born Manson works with a well established London-based opera company which concentrates on modern works. She is also building a reputation in other European countries, which she has visited with financial aid from the British Arts Council, and, since that first occasion, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects. 

B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE 

The most difficult part of being a conductor is deciding how to convince people to present you with the right opportunities; saysAndrew Constantine, 31, who won a major competition in 1991, after failed attempts in two other contests. Looking back, he is grateful for the timing: 'If it had happened any earlier, I am sure I would have disappeared without trace: The competition provided many performance opportunities and a period as assistant to a well-known conductor, but Constantine is finding it difficult to lose the 'competition' label: 'If in three years' time my name is still associated with the competition then I will be worried,' he says.'But orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra who took me on after the competition are now inviting me back. If this doesn't happen,your career will gradually fall to pieces.' 

C. WASFI KANI 

Wasfi Kani, who set up Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice period which is part of any opera production. 'The music is worth four weeks' attention; says Kani, who started conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she supported herself by working in London's commercial centre until Pimlico Opera turned fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons 
with Sian Edwards was the key moment for her. 'I saw her conduct and realised she was the same size as me - I had always been taught by much bigger people which makes a huge difference.' She likes the complicated nature of opera: 'There are lots of arguments, and you've got singers' personalities to consider ... ' 

D. ROGER VIGNOLES 

'Conducting has come upon me as something of a surprise, but it holds great fascination for me,' says Roger Vignoles, 48. In fact, it's not such a strange career move. He started out as a resident musician with an opera house, and worked with good conductors. Last year he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. 'It was much less difficult than I thought. I found I knew the music well, I knew what I wanted it to sound like, and I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. Fortunately, people have respected my ability as a musician generally. I am benefiting from every piece of experience I've ever had, both in musical style and in the actual business of performing. Now I will do whatever people ask me to do so I can find out what I like doing.' 

E. WAYNE MARSHALL 

It was back in 1986 that the conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor on one of his productions and told his agent about Wayne Marshall. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, a difficult beginning. He even had to deal with some over-relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: 'I was just tough with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. A lot of orchestral musicians I've seen don't seem to need advice and instruction from a conductor. But I'm never afraid to say what I want. If people see you're worried, it gets worse. I've never studied conducting formally and no book tells you how to conduct but people have been kind to me. I am determined and I know what I like.'

"On the rails

Five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys.
A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to get back there as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes.It never matters what the weather is like, or what time of the year it is, it is always enchanting. Out of the other window are some of the best back gardens and residences in the whole of France. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.
Raj Patel - Explorer
I have enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if I had to pick a favourite it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in my youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park. I was regarded as being too young and troublesome and was sent off to an aunt. When I came to live in England as a teenager, I still hadn't travelled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I ever saw and its great glass dome filled me with wonder.
Betty Cooper - Novelist
I am indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. It was on the train that my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was absolutely wonderful. Someone happened to mention that pink was good for the brain, and I've never stopped wearing the colour since. What I remember about the journey itself, however, is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Ll,!XOrI.t was, without a doubt, the perfect way to wind down after all the wedding preparations.
Martin Brown - Journalist
We were working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way we could continue our journey was to take what was affectionately known as the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We also heard that, in any case,the driver would often wait for days to depart if he knew there were people still on their way. When it appeared, there was a sudden charge of what seemed like hundreds of people climbing into and onto the carriages - people were even allowed to travel on the roof free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like travelling across the moon.
Arisu Mezuki - Actress
I imagine most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not my case. I was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains began to dominate my life. I made a film which featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, disused stretch of the line which had been lovingly maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we took every opportunity to have a ride on the train, and, when I went back last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!

"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS 

How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects, the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity. Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. 
The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians.
Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which tends to concentrate on the essential subjects - English, maths, basic sciences and languages - although provision can be made for students who wish to study a wider range of subjects. All five British specialist schools are independent, classes are small by normal school standards, with a high teacher/pupil ratio. Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders, leaving home to live, eat and sleep full-time at school. This means they spend their formative years in the company of others with similar aims and interests. 
What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is the cost; the fees are high (£12,000-£17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance, to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, specially at a very early age. Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment. They stress, however, that their main aim is to turn out 'rounded and well-balanced individuals'. 
There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress. Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years, while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed. In addition, while most former pupils at music school feel that they benefited enormously from the range of high-quality music teaching available, many express reservations about the wisdom of restricting the academic programme, which definitely takes second place to musical activities. Many musically gifted young people are also highly intelligent, well able to deal with academic pressure, and feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. For these reasons, it may be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education. 
Those who are equally gifted academically may do very well within a less specialised environment; for instance, at a school with a first class music department, or else by combining a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience. But this option is clearly not practicable for families living out of reach of London or other major centres. ",B2
"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots
Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'
For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.
This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.
Nevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.
As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.
The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.
However, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, members of the human race were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have got slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.

"Bitter water hits the big time

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is now part of a multi-million pound worldwide business. 

At Easter, British people spend over £230 million on chocolate. A massive eight per cent of all chocolate is bought at this time. 
Only at Christmas do people eat more of the cocoa-based foodstuffs. Although the large-scale industrial production of chocolate began in the last century, the cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec and Mayan civilisations of Central America over three thousand years ago. 
The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant which is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is melon-sized and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried they become cacao beans, which can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans. 
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also used them to make a drink called xocoatl. This is from the word in the Aztec language, Nahuatl, meaning 'bitter water'. In Aztec times the chocolate drink was flavoured with spices and used on ceremonial occasions and for welcoming visitors. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe did not spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. 
Until the last century, the chocolate drink was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten of the Netherlands invented chocolate powder. This was made by extracting most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. 
The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to produce a solid block that you could eat. A Swiss company then introduced milk solids to the process which gave us milk chocolate. 
At the turn of the century, the British chocolate market was dominated by French companies. In 1879 the English company Cadbury even named their Birmingham factory Bournville (ville is the French word for town) in the hope that a little French glamour would rub off. But then came Cadbury's famous Dairy Milk bar which began life as Dairymaid in 1905. Clever advertising which associated it with the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside quickly established the bar as a rival to the more decadent French brands. 
It seems that, for the time being at least, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week. This has forced manufacturers to look for new ways to attract customers. The latest marketing trick is the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert, to tempt chocoholics who have grown tired of conventional snacks. 
At the other end of the production process, cacao farmers are still feeling the effects of a crash in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. As most cacao farmers operate on a very small scale, many were forced out of business. Perhaps you could spare a thought for them as you munch your next chocolate bars. ",B2
"Fun at the Dentist’s?

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch which patients sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, ‘If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.’.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. ‘We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, ‘When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. ‘One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself’, he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he’d like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder. The surgery seems more like an elegant beauty parlour than a mainstream dental practice.",B2
"A heavy step sounded at the door and a man came in.
'We have company, Johann,' said my hostess, and the man pulled off his cap.
The moment he looked at me, to my surprise he took a step back as though, like the border official, he had seen something surprising.
'What's the matter, Johann?' asked the older girl. 'This is a gentleman on his travels, come to see the coronation.'
The man had calmed himself, but he was looking at me in a strange, almost fierce, manner.
'Good evening to you,' said I.
'Good evening, sir,' he replied in a low voice, and the younger girl began to laugh.
'See, Johann,' she said, 'it is the colour you love. He was surprised at your hair, sir. It's not the colour we see most of, here in Zenda.'
'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Johann.
I then said good night to them all and rose to my feet. The young girl ran to light the way to my room. Johann still looked at me strangely as I passed. While the girl was leading me up the stairs, she said: 'Master Johann could never be pleased with one of your colouring, sir.'
'Perhaps he prefers yours,' I suggested.
'I meant, sir, in a man.'
'What,' I asked, 'does hair colour matter in a man?'
'I don't know, sir, but I like yours - it's the Elphberg red.'
'Colour in a man,' said I, 'is a matter of no more importance than that!' - and I gave her something of no value.
'I hope the kitchen door is shut,' she said.
'Let's hope so,' I answered, and left her.
In fact, though, as I now know, hair colour is sometimes of great importance to a man.

"Food for all

We proudly present our own hand-picked special selection of the very best cookbook titles now on offer. 

A.
Ask anyone to think of a famous TV cook and writer, and it's frequently Delia Smith's name that comes to mind. Her recipes come from all over the world each marked by her enthusiasm for exciting food, plus her straightforward appreciation of what the average cook can do in the average kitchen. The book that established her reputation is Delia Smith's Complete Cookery Course, which has now become the kitchen reference book for the modern cook. Along with simple, but expert, guidance on all aspects of basic and more advanced cookery, Delia mixes her advice with hundreds of superb recipes that are anything but boring. Recently revised, it's more than ever the book that answers the question: 'If I could only have one cookbook, which would it be?'

It took Raymond Blanc just 15 years to move from amateur, untrained chef to chef/owner of the most famous French restaurant in Britain. Now, to accompany his first TV series, Blanc Mange, comes the book of the same name. Raymond wants to teach us all to be better cooks by demonstrating how and why certain ingredients react in certain ways. Good cooking is easy, in his view, when you really understand what's going on in the pan. Over 80 amazing recipes demonstrate exactly what he means. It's a very practical reference book, which is not above explaining why certain dishes can go wrong and introducing some basic food chemistry to clarify the points made. Monsieur Blanc loves to cook to entertain and, as this book proves, he's very, very good at it.

Le Cordon Bleu, three words which make you think of all that is best in classical French cooking. Over the past 100 years, the expert chefs of this most famous cooking school have trained all levels of students to achieve perfection. Now, to celebrate the school's impressive hundredth anniversary, comes this equally impressive new book, Le Cordon Bleu Classic French Cookbook, which contains 100 of the school's most respected recipes. Although the recipes in the book are all classics, they're all still remarkably fresh. While Le Cordon Bleu has always carried the flag for traditional French cooking, it has also moved away from rich, creamy sauces and altered its approach to cut down on the killer calories. Starting with a chapter on the basics of sound kitchen procedure, the book follows it up with Appetisers and Starters, Main dishes and, finally, Desserts. Throughout, the recipes are illustrated with step-by-step illustrations plus wonderful shots of the finished dishes. Expert chefs from Cordon Bleu schools around the world have each selected a recipe for which they are 
famous, and shared their secrets with the reader.

Fast food? Oh yuk! Surely it's accepted wisdom that good food means a long period of suffering in front of the cooker? Well, Nigel Slater, food editor of The Observer, doesn't think so as his new book, The 30-Minute Cook, will prove. Fast food, as Nigel says, 'is just what the world wants when it comes home tired and hungry and demanding something good to eat at once.' He's always believed it's perfectly possible to create something tasty in the time it takes to deliver a pizza, and he has already written two very successful books to prove it. In this great new book you'll find more enticing recipes, and each hits the table just 30 minutes after the word 'go'. Nigel has written down, in his jolly and enjoyable style, more than 200 recipes from around the world. Just because he likes his food fast, it doesn't mean this bright young writer doesn't appreciate good food. If you don't believe fast food can be great food, try his recipes: they're simply delicious. ",B2
"The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying off to wonderful locations and appearing on the covers of magazines, you'll probably find her revising for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 

'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in an awful mood and refuse to answer my questions. 
But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic and with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. 
Kira gives the impression of being slightly puzzled by her new-found fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should take part in the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. 
The achievement of being selected for the final [line 38: beginning] gave Kira the confidence to go through with it and [line 38: end] she performed perfectly. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. 
Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become accustomed to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I have too high an opinion of myself.' This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.' 
As a busy model though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can ring at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modelling now, you never have time for us"".' 
Kira has the looks, ability and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.' ",B2
"My line of work

Four people talk about their jobs.
Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum
I'm responsible for putting temporary exhibitions together. This includes planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. I have to read up about the subject of the exhibition beforehand and then talk to important people in the area so that I can establish the main themes and aims of the exhibition, and plan what objects and pictures should be displayed. I have to make sure the public can understand the thinking behind the exhibition, which means planning interactive displays, workshops and theatre. I also have to bring in engineers and electricians to make sure the final display is not dangerous to visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write the brochures and leaflets that we'll use to tell people about it.

Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers
The first thing I do when I get here at 7.30 a.m. is check the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents need to be produced in order to learn the 'runs' or routes necessary to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, working out how to make the journeys. They work out the most direct route, using the correct one-way streets, and right- and left- hand turns. I get involved when there's a difference of opinion - like whether you can do a right turn at a particular junction. When they're close to the test, I'll give them a simple route and no matter what way they say they'll go, I'll tell them they have to use another route because the road is closed. The next student will have to find a third route and again I'll come up with a reason why they can't go that way. It's just to make them think.

Sarah - Marine Conservationist
I live by the coast and work from home. This involves responding to telephone enquiries, producing educational resources and setting up training courses. Occasionally, I go into our main office but generally I am on the coast. I also work with schools and study centres and run courses for coastal managers and those involved in making decisions about the fate of the seas.I do things like take them out to sea in a boat in an attempt to make them think more about the life underneath them. This often changes their views as it's very different from making decisions using a computer screen. I am extremely lucky because conservation is my hobby, so the job has many highs for me. The downside of the job is that I work for a charity, so there is a constant need for more money. This means I'm always looking for more resources and I'm not able to achieve everything I want.

Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
My work is pretty varied. I have to make sure that the publishing programme matches market requirements, and ensure that we keep stocks of 300 or so of the books that we publish. We have very high standards of information and content. We receive many letters from readers on issues such as the representation of international boundaries and these in particular require a careful response. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work as part of an enthusiastic group which makes the job that much more enjoyable. The negative side, as with many jobs, is that there is far too much administration to deal with, which leaves less time to work on the more interesting tasks such as product development and design.

"GETTING FIT 

Exercise is essential for mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when all around you everything seems more and more unbalanced and the world becomes ever more fast and furious. 
Don't groan because this is yet another article about fitness. The reason why there are so many is that it is seriously good for you. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It improves muscle power and promotes good posture - the way in which you hold your body when sitting or standing. It helps prevent those muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It provides quick improvement in specific problem areas such as thighs, stomach and upper arms. It improves the condition of the heart and lungs and blood circulation. 
Probably all these reasons have been thrown at you time and time again, so maybe you are bored by them and have switched off. All right then, this should make you sit up and take notice. Did you know that exercise helps to ease depression and tiredness, and that it helps to regulate sleep patterns? Also that exercise is instrumental in controlling stress? Not only this, but exercise can help to relieve certain medical conditions. 
By now you should be influenced a little by these arguments. If not, common sense alone should tell you that exercise is good for you. 
There are plenty of types of exercise you can do aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, working out with free weights, working on weight machines. There is one point you should note - training too hard and with too much weight may cause injury, so start slowly and carefully. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. 
No amount of exercise will improve your body shape if you don't have good posture. This practically determines how you look and feel. Not only is a stiff or sagging body unattractive, it also lacks energy and is more likely to suffer from minor health complaints. 
If your body tends to slouch, imagine that the top of your head is connected to a helium balloon, which is trying to pull you up into the sky. This will help you to lift the chest for fuller and easier breathing. At the same time, it lengthens the abdomen, making the body look much slimmer. If the chest is well balanced when you are standing, you can see your ankles. 
Stretching the muscles improves flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely. 
The best exercise, therefore, involves a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout and definitely a cool down period. ",B2
"'Archie,' said Mrs Easterbrook to her husband, 'listen to this.' Colonel Easterbrook paid no attention. He was busy reading The Times. 'These reporters know nothing about India,' he said. 'Nothing! If they did, they wouldn't write such rubbish.' 
'Yes, I know,' said his wife. 'Archie, do listen. A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks at 6.30 p.m. Friends, please accept this, the only notice.' She paused. Colonel Easterbrook smiled at her affectionately. 'It's the Murder Game,' he said. 'That's all. One person's the murderer, but nobody knows who. The lights go out. The murderer chooses the person he's going to murder. This person has to count to twenty before he screams. Then the person who's been chosen to be the detective questions everybody. It's a good game - if the detective knows something about police work.' 
'Like you, Archie. You had to deal with all those interesting cases in India. Why didn't Miss Blacklock ask you to help her organise the game?' 'Oh, well, she's got that young nephew staying with her,' said Colonel Easterbrook. 'I expect this is his idea.' 'It was in the Personal Column. I suppose it is an invitation?' 
'Strange kind of invitation. I'm not going.' 
'Oh, but Archie,' said his wife, 'I really do think you ought to go - just to help Miss Blacklock. I'm sure she's depending on you to make the game a success. One must be a good neighbour.' 
Mrs Easterbrook put her blonde head on one side and opened her blue eyes very wide. Colonel Easterbrook twisted his grey moustache, and looked at his wife.

"What sort of shopper are you? 

Love it or hate it, we all go shopping. But there are different types of shopper. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around ... 

A. Melanie, 22, dancer

I'm an addict - I can't spend enough money! When I have the cash I'm out there and then I don't get miserable. I definitely have difficulty walking past sale signs. My boyfriend's exactly the same, so we often drag each other around the shops. We're an addicted couple! 

B. Brenda, 40, office manager

I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he does the cooking and knows what he likes. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes ... I do take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter out to get clothes, but I don't enjoy that either, as we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself regularly, so when I do splash out I tend to feel guilty and rarely tell my husband how much I've spent - I always knock the price down a bit! The real price always sounds so shocking. 

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager

I only shop for essentials I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and I won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something I'd rather be doing. 

D. Anita, 35, TV producer

I like a good look round every now and then but I tend to know what I want, and where to find it. I don't waste time and I get in and out as quickly as I can. I do have hidden mistakes at the back of my wardrobe though so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes gets particular purchases wrong! 

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary

I don't enjoy shopping in the least. I really dislike shopping for clothes as I can never find what I want, or anyone to help me look for it. The shops are too noisy, everything is disordered and I find it an absolute nightmare. Fortunately, I rarely have to shop for clothes as most of my clothes are given to me. As for food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and get it over and done with quickly! 

F. Lisa, 22, actress

I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I'll go out for a look around the shops with my girlfriends - and we'll often end up spending. I don't usually go out with a certain item in mind, but if something catches my eye I'll buy it. 

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant

I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't really buy very much. I usually know what I want and I seldom go crazy. I do sometimes shop to cheer myself up - but I usually end up feeling much worse because I've spent too much! 

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker 

I love shopping - but only on certain days and never on a Saturday, as it's far too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper ... I always set off with a fair idea of what I want, and I never snap things up immediately. I have to look in other shops, in case I can find a better bargain - I take ages! 

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager

I'm an unwilling shopper - maybe because I work in the city centre, the shops have lost their attraction for me. When I have to, I'll drag myself out - but I don't bother to try things on, it's far too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much and I'd rather make a few mistakes than have to go into shops and make a lot of effort! ",B2
"Where I get my energy

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the full to tell us how they do it. 

A. Jeanette Kupfermann

Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning, I get tremendous energy. Anything to do with rhythm gives me energy, too - at the moment I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive and energising. I think you can feel drained if you're bored, maybe feeling life is pointless. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' 

B. Linda Kelsey

Magazine editor: 'I have so much work to do but I enjoy it all - I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even though you may be feeling tired. I need a fair bit of sleep so when I do get it I feel really good. When I'm 
running at six hours' sleep a night, I feel a bit wet. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's finding the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and I try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've done exercise, my spirits rise amazingly. I get very low patches in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's probably good to eat something then.' 

C. Annie Nightingale

Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives, grab the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You've got to achieve things and set yourself various goals. I enjoy what I do and the last two years have been very exciting. In my line of business there are lots of lively young people and you can't help being affected by that. I love tearing around the place on jobs, having a mad life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photographs but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them processed and can't wait to get them back. 
I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and it's a good release for my mind when I'm doing a lot of travelling.' 

D. Floella Benjamin

Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family and I think that being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids, they give out so much and have an inbuilt resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered off by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill you get when they smile back. It's far better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' 

E. Deborah Moggach

Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything in the world is making a garden out of complete wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I smashed up all the concrete and dug in loads of soil. It was far better than any amount of workouts or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing that somebody wants to read what I'm writing - I find it difficult to write in a void. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm found, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private property,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' 

F. Katherine Monblot

Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be a member of various committees and resented the demands they made on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so direct it into the things that are most important to you.'

"No Title

Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had only just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact, nobody to tell you that their bedsit would be vacant at the end of the month. No, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching.
For Jo, Dublin was a very big blank spot. She really felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go. Who would stay in a one-horse town, the back of beyond, the end of the world, the sticks? That's all she had heard for years. They were all going to get out, escape, see some life, get some living in, have a real kind of existence, and some of the others in her class had gone as far as the towns of Ennis or Limerick, where an elder sister or an aunt would see them settled in. But out of Jo's year, none of them were going to Dublin. She was heading off on her own.
Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel. It was run by nuns, and she would come to no harm. Her father said that he hoped they kept the place warm; hostels were well known for being freezing. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel as waitresses, said she must be off her head to have stayed a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking about her and discussing her, as she answered the advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too dear!
There wasn't a queue for this one because it wasn't so much 'Flat to Let', more 'Third Girl Wanted'. The fact that it said 'own television' made Jo wonder whether it might be too high a class for her, but the house did not look in any way overpowering. An ordinary red-brick terraced house with a basement. But the flat was not in the basement, it was upstairs. And a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and went on climbing.
'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' printed on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that toffee-nosed girl going out? I can't stand that kind, I can't stand them.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just poked around and pulled a face and sort of giggled and then said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her in here, would we, Pauline?'
Pauline had a psychedelic shirt on, so colourful it almost hurt the eyes, but even so it was only slightly brighter than her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with amazement. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I rang.' Nessa said they were just about to have a mug of tea. She produced three mugs; one had 'Nessa' and one had 'Pauline' and the other one had 'Other' written on it. 'We'll get your name put on if you come to stay,' she said generously.",B2
"Kowloon Walled City had no wall around it. 
Standing apart from the neighbouring buildings, it rose to fourteen floors-buildings with more buildings piled on top. Legally, it belonged to the People's Republic of China, a part of the colony that was never British. 
In fact, neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. The police of both countries stayed away, as should outsiders. Below ground level, narrow streets crossed beneath the buildings. Beggars competed with drug dealers in the light from bulbs that hung from wires running along the stone walls. The air smelled of decay. 
Near the entrance to the market, a woman sat on a low wooden chair, her thick legs parted, skinning snakes. Her dark eyes concentrated on each moving creature in her hands. Coming around the corner at the opposite end of the market, a poorly-dressed man turned into the busy street. He was dressed in a cheap, loose-fitting brown suit, the pants too wide and the jacket too large. 
A soft hat, black and unmistakably Chinese, threw a shadow over his face. He walked slowly, stopping in front of tables and examining the things on sale. Bent over, he looked like a man who worked in the fields or on the boats. He looked, in fact, like many of the men in the market. 
The man approached the snake seller. ""Where is the great one?"" he said. ""You are early."" ""I was told to come quickly. Do you question the taipan's instructions?"" ""Go down the steps behind me and take the first street to the left. A woman will be standing fifteen, twenty meters down. She is waiting for you.""

"However, most of the problems were small and most of the guests at the conference were amazed by the network. After this, the ARPAnet began to grow even more rapidly. But now it was not the world's only network of computers.
After the ARPAnet had shown that a computer network could be built and that it could be useful, other networks began to appear. Universities, government departments and other organizations saw that networking could multiply the power of their computers - and the power of the people who used them.
But these new networks created their own rules. A system that was best for the ARPAnet did not necessarily suit other organizations with different needs, different styles of work and different hardware.
So, once again, there were many different computer systems that could not talk to each other. Now, just a few years after the ARPAnet was invented, the appearance of new networks had once again created the problem that had caused Bob Taylor to imagine the world's first computer network.
By this time, Bob Kahn was in charge of the ARPAnet project. He was very familiar with the new problem because he had worked on some of the newer networks. They were all designed to deal with different circumstances. For example, the Alohanet network in Hawaii used radio waves to deal with the problem of communicating over mountains and between different islands.
The network in the San Francisco area was not even fixed: it was on lorries which moved around from place to place. The Atlantic Packet Satellite Network used another system, sending messages up to satellites in space to communicate across half the world.

"Five-star luxury meets up-to-date technology

The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of considerable research into customer requirements and nearly two years' work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike.
At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel.
Though the system cost £250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers.
For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences.
Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort. Guests have the opportunity to change the temperature themselves within three degrees either side of the normal l8°C but, in addition, each individual room can be adjusted by any amount between 14°C and 25°C at the front desk.
For guests, though, it is the other technology offered in their rooms which is most likely to find favour. This is particularly true for the business user, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five per cent of his business will come from this part of the market. To provide the best service for such needs, the hotel has taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms. Each one has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.
Technology changes so quickly these days that the hotel has had to try to forecast possible improvements. Extra cables have been laid to handle whatever scientific advances may occur. The televisions are rented rather than bought, so that they can be replaced with more up-to- date models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.
Despite the presence of all this very up-to-the-minute equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried hard not to make guests feel threatened by technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms, large and well-furnished, are both comfortable and welcoming. There are, of course, a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars and two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the heart of it all.
As at all luxury hotels, the food that is offered to guests must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he agreed to move his restaurant business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel site has huge benefits, both for him and the hotel itself. He has been able to design a new kitchen and take it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at the previous address, too. From the hotel's side, they are able to offer a popular and successful place to eat, with no financial risks attached. Aided by technology and a highly capable staff, the Merrion looks likely to succeed.

"An eye for detail
Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.
With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently. She now employs an extra gardener but, despite the need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.",B2
"No Title

Many trees in the Brackham area were brought down in the terrible storms that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had altered the appearance of the town centre entirely, to the annoyance of its more conservative inhabitants.
Among the annoyed, under more normal circumstances, would have been Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force. But at the height of that week's storm, when the wind brought down even the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham had in fact been in no fit state to notice. A large and healthy man, he had for the first time in his life been seriously ill with an attack of bronchitis.
When he first complained of an aching head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, had tried to persuade him to go to the doctor. Convinced that the police force could not do without him, he had, as usual, ignored her and attempted to carry on working. Predictably, though he wouldn't have listened to anyone who tried to tell him so, this had the effect of fogging his memory and shortening his temper.
It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took the initiative and drove him to the doctor's door that he finally gave in. By that time, he didn't have the strength left to argue with her. In no time at all, she was taking him along to the chemist's to get his prescribed antibiotics and then home to his unsurprised wife who sent him straight to bed.
When Molly told him, on the Thursday morning, that the walnut tree had been brought down during the night, Pelham hadn't been able to take it in. On Thursday evening, he had asked weakly about damage to the house, groaned thankfully when he heard there was none, and pulled the sheets over his head.
It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics took effect, his temperature dropped and he got up, that he realised with a shock that the loss of the walnut tree had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The Pelhams' large house stood in a sizeable garden. It had not come cheap, but even so Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The leafy garden had created an impression of privacy. Now, though, the storm had changed his outlook.
Previously, the view from the living-room had featured the handsome walnut tree. This had not darkened the room because there was also a window on the opposite wall, but it had provided interesting patterns of light and shade that disguised the true state of the worn furniture that the family had brought with them from their previous house.
With the tree gone, the room seemed cruelly bright, its worn furnishings exposed in all their shabbiness. And the view from the window didn't bear looking at. The tall house next door, previously hidden by the tree, was now there, dominating the outlook with its unattractive purple bricks and external pipes. It seemed to have a great many upstairs windows, all of them watching the Pelhams' every movement.
'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham croaked to his wife.
But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more pleased than dismayed. 'That's what I've been telling you ever since we came here. We have to buy a new sofa, whatever it costs.'",B2
"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England’s netball captain.

Kendra Slawinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park.
I was surprised to hear about her training venue.
'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 'I'm too involved in what I'm doing concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else,' she said.'I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.'
'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them. These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part.
'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.'
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the opening ceremony. As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.'
The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra.But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We’re all friendlier after the game.' 
Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing.
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra.
As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.'
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned.
Doubtless she will coach young players in the future, but at the moment her eyes are firmly set on her last big event. As she leads out her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is more than likely to have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be behind her every step of the way.",B2

"BICYCLES 

The bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about one hundred and fifty years ago. 
At first bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could buy one. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought one. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. 
Today, people use cars more than bicycles; cars are much faster and you don't get wet when it rains! But some people still prefer to cycle to work. They say that there are too many cars in town centres and you can't find anywhere to park!

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh’s best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. 
Gail’s manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it’s no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can’t catch her up. 
Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays. ‘I am with her all the time,’ says Mike. ‘Sometimes I say, “Are you sure you should be eating that?” It’s usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.’

"Slowly, Gabriel went up the stairs to the Delgados' flat. The building
was dangerous, but he didn't think about that. He could hear the cries of
the child. He felt terrible. Then he felt something on the floor under his
foot. He looked down. It was his red rose. It was there, in the same place,
by the front door. A rose from another world, another life.
The door of the flat was open. Gabriel called, 'Mrs Delgado! Silvia! Are you there?'
There was no answer, but suddenly, two men ran out of the sitting-room.
The first man went down the stairs before Gabriel could stop him.
Then the other man ran past. Gabriel put out his foot and the man fell
over it. A box fell to the ground. The man didn't stop. He jumped up
and ran away.
Gabriel opened the box. There was jewellery inside it.
'Mrs. Delgado's jewellery!' he thought. 'So the thieves are busy now!'
He took the jewellery box into the flat. He looked round. The pictures
were on the walls. Silvia's camera was on the table.
'Good,' he thought. 'The thieves didn't have much time. They only took the jewellery, and I've got it now.'
Then, near one of the armchairs, he saw Silvia's dirty evening shoes. He thought for a minute. For the first time for hours, he smiled. 'She wore those shoes last night,' he thought. 'So she came back here after the earthquake. She isn't dead! She came home, and took her mother to a safe place. Oh Silvia, Silvia, you're all right!'

But Esther didn't listen to them. She just kept on making jam. After a few months, she started selling it to the local market. Then she started making orange juice.

"The Elephant Show 

by Daniel Allsop, age 14 

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. 
We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant’s trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers’ instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. 
Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

'Bollywood', which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.
Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million.

10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes.

"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much.
About 300 years ago, London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible.
In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street.
Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men.

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dog.
The two smaller sizes first came to England over 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer has not been here very long. The name Giant is a good one because the dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm high.
All the dogs have long hair, which should be cut quite often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey in colour, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black.
Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use the dogs to help them with their sheep, and they are also used by the police, because Schnauzer dogs are very intelligent.
A Schnauzer makes a nice family dog. It is friendly and very good with young children.",A2
"Corryvale Farm

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep.
She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts this wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash.
That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present. On the walls of Jenny's office, there are lots of letters from happy customers all over the world.",A2
"Mount Kilimanjaro 

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. 
There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. 
Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so suddenly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes!

"The Rhino

There are five different types of rhino in the world today. The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The others live in forests in Asia.
All rhinos have big, heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. Each foot has three toes. They usually walk very slowly, but they can run at 50 kilometres an hour. Rhinos are usually quiet and calm animals, and they only eat grass and other plants.
A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos when it is born. It has been inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and may live to be 50 years old.",A2

"There were many big fights at that time. People fought on horses with swords in their hands. The strongest and best knight always won.
'Perhaps the new king will come to the fight,' thought the Archbishop.
Sir Ector went to the fight with his two sons, Sir Kay and young Arthur. Arthur was now sixteen years old. The young men wanted to fight with the other knights, but Sir Kay did not have a sword. Arthur was a kind young man. He wanted to help. 
' There is a sword in a stone outside a church. I saw it on the way here. I will get it and fight with it. Then you can have my sword,' he said to his brother.
Arthur left Sir Kay and quickly went to the church. There were no knights outside by the stone because they were at the fight. Arthur climbed down from his horse and went to the stone. He did not read the words on the stone. He took the sword in his hand and pulled. It came out of the stone easily.
He ran back to his horse with the sword. Some minutes later he met Sir Kay and Sir Ector again, and he showed them the sword.
'Where did that sword come from? ' Sir Ector asked. He knew about the words on the stone.
They went back to the place outside the church, and Sir Ector put the sword in the stone again.
'Now pull it out,' he said to Arthur.
Arthur pulled it out. It came out as easily as a knife out of butter. Sir Ector saw this and took Arthur's hand. 'You are my king,' he said.

"Then he climbed out of the water. He hit the fish on the head with a rock. He gave some fish to Peter, and he carried the other fish. They took them to Mary, and cooked them for breakfast. They couldn't eat them all, so they carried some for their dinner later.
That evening, they sat round the fire and ate yarrawa. Then the bush boy suddenly got up and started to dance. He danced round the fire. He danced very fast. Then suddenly, in the middle of his dance, he sneezed. He sneezed again and again. He felt weak and ill, so he sat down. He put his hand to his face, and it was hot and wet. But he also felt very cold, and now he was afraid.
'This is the end,' he thought. 'I'm going to die now.'
Peter and Mary watched the bush boy.
'What's he doing?' asked Peter.
'I don't know,' said Mary. 'It's very strange. Perhaps he caught your cold.'
Later, when it was dark, Peter and Mary slept. But the bush boy stood on the rocks and looked out at the desert again for a long time. The fire was warm, and he tried to sleep near it. But he sneezed often, and he was very cold. He couldn't get warm. In the morning, he didn't make a fire, and there wasn't any breakfast.
'Mary, is he ill?' asked Peter.
'No, he's not ill,' answered Mary. But she didn't really know.
Peter went to the bush boy. 'Hey, boy, are you OK? Let's go. Adelaide, remember? We have to go to Adelaide.'

"'I am quite well,' I always answered.
Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because, in one sense, it was true. I was not in pain.
'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village,' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old. The village girls and the young farmer's wife were only ill for a few days, and then they died.'
Carmilla was also suffering strange dreams and feelings. But she was not as ill as me. I did not understand why I was ill. I was living inside a dream world and I could not think sensibly.
One night, I heard a different voice in my dream. It was not the clear female voice that I usually heard. It was sweet, but also terrible.
'This is your mother,' it said. I did not know the voice, because I never knew my mother. 'Someone is trying to kill you. You must be careful.'
At exactly the same time, my candle suddenly burned brightly. I saw my room clearly. There, at the foot of my bed, I saw Carmilla. She wore her white nightdress, but from head to foot she was washed in blood. I woke up with a terrible scream. The next minute, I was standing outside my room, crying for help. Madame Perrodon and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine arrived quickly.
'I have had a terrible dream,' I said. I described it to them. I could see in their faces that they understood my terror.
'Poor child!' said Madame Perrodon. 'Mademoiselle De LaFontaine, please bring a cover from Laura's bed. She is cold.'

"CROCODILES 

We can find crocodiles in tropical parts of the world, for example Africa, South America and Northern Australia. 
They spend most of the time in slow-moving water but they can move fast through the water and on land. 
You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch, like fish, birds and small animals. And sometimes they make a meal of large animals or even people. 
There are more than ten types of crocodile. They all have very sharp teeth. They often lose these teeth, but soon get new ones. 
Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 metres long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles live for a long time. The oldest one kept in a zoo was 66 years old.

""Maybe his chemicals will teach me more about toys, decorations, and Christmas trees! I'll go to his house and discuss everything with him in the morning.""

"Big cats 

There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. 
Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! 
Lions are the only cats that stay together in large family groups. Several lions may work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. 
All cats need good eyes, because they catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast, and very strong. ",A2

"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL 

In 1783, two French brothers built the first balloon to take people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew in it. This was in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office began the first airmail service. 
Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. Then, in the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. 
In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and it can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the journey from London to New York is only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is difficult to think of a world without them.

The bear can be a dangerous animal. The adult bear is very strong and it can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and they can run very fast. But they cannot see well and, like most animals, they find food by using their noses.
There are seven kinds of bear: The largest is the white polar bear, which is almost three metres tall. There are two kinds of black bear: One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown.
Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is difficult to find food.",A2
"Faisal was a rich young man of Baghdad. He lived in a large house with many servants. But he didn't have a wife. He wasn't interested in love.
One day Faisal went for a walk in the streets of the city. He saw a lot of young girls in front of him. He didn't want to meet them, so he turned into a small street. He looked up and saw a beautiful young girl at a window. From that minute, Faisal was in love.
Then a man on a horse came into the street. He had many servants with him. He stopped outside the girl's house and went inside.
'Is that her father?' Faisal thought.
He went home, but he couldn't eat or sleep. He thought about the girl. Who was she? He had to know.
An old woman worked in Faisal's house. She asked, 'What's wrong with you, sir? Are you ill?'

"WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE

Nicola Peet left school at eighteen, went to college and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she went to work for Saudi Arabian Airlines and then she joined British Airways as an air hostess. Four years later, she got her present job as a manager.
This is what she told us about her job:
'My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time in the air. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems. I also go to lots of meetings.
My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses.
Sometimes I go on long flights to check how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favourite part of the job, but I like office work, too. Travelling can be hard work. When I get back from a long journey, all I can do is eat something and then go to bed! I don't earn much money, but I'm happy with British Airways and want to stay there and continue to travel.'",A2

"The picture on the right shows what the Earth looks like from space.  Can you see the continent of Africa? About 70% of the surface is covered with water.  Most of the water is in the oceans and seas.  But there is also a lot of water in rivers and lakes, and even under the ground.  The north and south poles are covered with ice, which is frozen water. The south pole is the white area at the bottom of the picture. The clouds in the sky are made of tiny drops of water.  Water is the most important liquid in the world!
We could not survive without water.  We need water to drink and to cook our food.  We use it to wash and to keep ourselves clean and healthy.  Many people eat fish, which are caught in the sea or in lakes or rivers. We need water to grow our crops. In fact, all the animals and plants, on which we depend for our food, clothing and shelter, need water to survive.  Modern man also uses huge amounts of water in his many different industries. 
Water is the most important liquid in the world.  But water can also be a solid, or even a gas.  (a) What different names do we give to water when it is a solid and when it is a gas?  (b) Where would you expect to find water that is solid and water that is a gas?",A2

"After a long, hard swim, Pedro Serrano fell onto a beach, tired but alive. There was no sign now of his broken ship, lost under the waves. He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. 
The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. It was a good size-a walk of many hours from one end to the other. But it was made of sand. There were no plants on it, no pools or rivers. His new home was a desert. All hope now left him. It was the 1520s. Spanish ships visited the Caribbean regularly, but the ocean was very big and this island was small and unimportant. 
He probably had a wait of many years before any ships passed his way. ""My friends from the ship were lucky,"" he thought. ""Their deaths in the waves were quick."" He could imagine his own death on this desert island-slow, painful, lonely. But he pushed away these fears. He needed food and drink ... soon. 
After some searching, he found some shellfish and insects. He ate them uncooked. He had no way to light a fire. Later that day Serrano saw some big turtles climbing out of the ocean onto the beach. He ran toward them and quickly turned them onto their backs. Their legs danced in the air. He cut into their skin with the knife that he always kept in his belt. Then he drank their blood thirstily. He cut the meat out of their shells and dried it in the sun.

"Britain ruled British North America. When more English people started arriving, the French people became afraid of losing their language and way of living. The Aboriginal peoples were also unhappy about living on special lands set aside for them. Their way of living also was in danger of being lost. Many people wanted change.
Before 1867, Canada was called British North America (BNA). It was not a country. It was divided into areas called colonies. A colony is an area under the control of another country. Britain was the mother country of these colonies. It defended its colonies in British North America and had a special trade relationship with them. In this unit, you will learn the story of how the colonies of British North America joined together to become the country of Canada. This joining together of colonies into a country is called Confederation.
Before Confederation, British North America had six different colonies. There were also other areas under the control of the British government but they were not colonies. We can study these colonies and areas better by dividing them into regions. A region is an area of land that has a similar geography, people and activities. Different colonies in the same region often had similar ideas and ways of living. These ideas and ways of living were different from people that lived in other regions. You will be reading about what life was like in the colonies in five different regions of Canada. 
Who were the different groups of people living in the colonies of British North America? The three largest groups were the English, the French, and the Aboriginal peoples.",A2
"I also moved some guns and other things to this bigger cave. I wanted to have guns near me when I was at my country house. I was more intelligent than 500 cannibals !
Every morning, I took some guns and walked about three miles to my place on the hill. I watched and waited for the cannibals. But nobody came. Nothing happened. I watched every morning for months, but I didn't see anybody.
Then I went back to my old life and looked for food in the mornings. I didn't visit that hill for a long time. I tried to forget about the mark on the beach and the bones. I tried, but I couldn't forget.
It was now the end of the summer of my twenty-third year on this island. I had a lot of work in my garden. I looked at the corn every morning very early. One morning, before it was light, I saw a fire on the beach. It was about two miles away, near the hill. I ran quickly to the hill and looked for the fire.
I saw nine men on the beach below me. They wore no clothes. They sat round a small fire. The weather was very hot, so the fire was for food. They danced - they moved their arms and legs quickly up and down. After an hour, the water in the sea was high on the beach. The nine men got into their boats and began to leave.
I ran back to my cave for my gun. When I came to the hill again, I saw their two boats on the sea. Then I saw three other boats. The five boats went north.

They have always been friends and classmates. Like all their other friends, they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months, they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because they have a lot of homework. They have made a new computer word game.
The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin, who had problems with his reading. Kevin learns words more easily by seeing pictures and hearing information than he does by reading. His brother wanted to help. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make a computer game and now it's ready to use. It's a speaking and picture game. For example, if you look at the word 'hat', there's a drawing of a hat next to it and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time.
The two boys have won a lot of prizes for their computer game and it will soon be on sale around the world. Many schools are interested in buying it.",A2
"Parrots 

Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds, with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil, Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit, they are sometimes a problem for farmers. 
There are many different kinds of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet, which they use for climbing and holding food. The biggest birds can live for up to 80 years. 
They are very noisy, but they are clever birds and it is easy to teach them to talk. Some zoos have parrot shows, where you can see the birds doing things they have learned.

"I felt very sad. Marley was my friend and I loved him. I didn't want to find a new home for him. But I also had a wife and two small children. I had to think about them.
I talked to my friends and neighbours about Marley.
""Do you want a Labrador?"" I asked. But nobody did. I looked in the newspapers. They were full of ads from people with dogs, and a lot of the ads were for Labradors. ""These people paid a lot of money for their dogs,"" I thought. ""But now they're looking for new homes for them. Maybe Labradors are too difficult-too big and strong.""
Marley wasn't an easy dog. He wasn't obedient and he broke things. But we brought him to our home when he was a puppy. He loved us and we loved him. He was our dog.
I took Marley back to the obedience class. A different teacher was there now. This time, things went better. I said ""Sit!"" and Marley sat. I put the chain around his neck and he walked quietly next to me. I said ""Stay!"" and he stayed. I walked away from him, but he didn't move. Then I turned and said, ""Come!"" Marley ran quickly to me.
""Good boy, Marley,"" I said. ""Good, good, good boy!""
At the end of the eight weeks, the teacher gave me a paper. It said, ""Marley did well in the obedience class."" I was very happy. On the way home, I sang.
After this, a wonderful thing happened. Jenny got better. She stopped being sad, and was strong and happy. She was a good mother to Patrick and Conor, and she was kind to Marley again.

"The Weather 

People are interested in the weather for a lot of reasons and it is important for people in many different jobs. For example, the weather makes a big difference for farmers. 
Many years ago, farmers spent a long time looking at the sky and at animals and flowers to try and learn more about the weather. Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. 
Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain. ",A2
"""There's something out there! It threw an orange at me!"" Elliott said. ""Ooooo!"" said Tyler, a friend of Elliott. ""An orange! Very dangerous!"" Elliott's mom, Mary, took a light, and then she and the boys went into the yard. ""What did you see?"" Mary asked Elliott. ""Something there,"" he answered. He pointed to the end of the yard. Elliott's brother, Michael, said, ""Look, something walked across the ground here!"" The extra-terrestrial looked at them from the dark. There were five Earth children, and a tall, beautiful person. Strange sounds came from her mouth. He couldn't understand them. Was she their mother? His heart-light started to shine, so he put his hand over it. She was the most beautiful of Earth people. 
The extra-terrestrial looked and looked. ""Stupid heart-light,"" he said-but it shone more and more. The Earth people went back into the kitchen. Later in the night, three of the children left the house. They were Elliott's friends, Greg, Tyler, and Steve. Then, the lights went out and the house was quiet. The extra-terrestrial walked across the yard to the plants. It was very dark now, so he couldn't see. He hit his head and fell back on the ground.
He cried out loudly. Suddenly, the kitchen door opened and Elliott ran out into the yard with his dog, Harvey. He shone a light into the plants and saw the extraterrestrial. Elliott shouted-and fell over. The extra-terrestrial started to run.
""Don't go!"" Elliott said.

"The Ruwenzori Mountains 

Mary Daniels is a student in England. This year she had a very interesting summer holiday. She travelled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns. 'It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where we could buy food,' said Mary. 'It was also very cold and wet in the mountains. It is one of the wettest places in the world.' 
Mary stayed in the mountains for six weeks. It was hard work, but she says it was the best thing she has ever done. She is hoping to return next year to do some more work there.

"Then one day, about a month after the fight between Marian and Robin, Will Scarlet told them an interesting story.
'People in the village of River Dale are talking about a fat friar,' he said. 'They say he came to the village last month. Now he lives near the river. For one penny, he will take people across the river in his boat. When poor people cannot pay, he carries them across on his back ! People say he loves good food and a good fight. He is a very strange friar, I think.'
' And I think that man is Friar Tuck,' laughed Marian. ' Robin, please go to River Dale and bring him back with you.'
Robin and Will Scarlet walked with Marian to her uncle's house and then went back through the forest to the village of River Dale.
'Wait here, Will,' said Robin. 'Marian says the friar is a strong man and very brave. I'd like to try him!'
Robin then walked to the river and looked across it. He saw the friar's little house, and his boat.
'Good friar,' he called, 'where are you? Will you take me in your boat ? I have some money and I can pay you well.'
Friar Tuck came out of the house and got into the boat. He came quickly across the river.
'Show me your money first,' said the friar. ' Then you can get in.'
He jumped from the boat to dry ground and held out his hand. Robin gave him a penny and walked to the boat. But he didn't get in. He pushed the boat and it moved slowly away, down the river.

"Kong went back to Ann and took her down from the high rock. For the
first time in this jungle, she felt strangely safe. He jumped across a ravine
and then across a river. She was a small plaything between his large fingers.
Then he stopped and put her down. She looked up and high above her head was a statue of a giant gorilla. ""That's you, Kong!"" she said. Kong looked at Ann, a very small person, and at the giant statue. He understood something for the first time: ""To this beautiful woman, I am an ugly giant."" He looked at his hands and then, with sad eyes, at Ann. Slowly and carefully, he picked her up again and took her to a very high mountain. From up there Ann could see the ship, only about five kilometers away. The orange sun slowly went down in the west. When Kong put Ann
down, she saw the skull of a giant gorilla on the ground near her. Was this
his mother's or his father's skull? Maybe his brother's or his wife's? Ann understood. He had nobody and she was his only family now. Ann put her hand on Kong's arm but he didn't look at her. She wanted to make him happy, so she danced for him. But he didn't look. ""Look at me,"" she said. ""Look!"" Slowly, he turned and put one finger in front of her. She put her arms around it and he pulled her up.

"THE OSTRICH 

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can be more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few of them left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour, so it is very difficult for other animals to catch them. 
Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.

"Madame Tussaud's

One very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Here people can see figures of famous people made of wax.
Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, a doctor, made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. Marie helped him in his work.
In 1789,during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. Here she had to copy the heads of famous people when they were dead, including Queen Marie Antoinette's.
In 1795,Marie married Francois Tussaud and in 1802 she came to London with her wax figures. Here she opened a museum and her figures can still be seen today.",A2
"Gandhi went to many different places in India and he met thousands of ordinary people. He went everywhere by train. He always sat in third class because he remembered South Africa.
A famous Indian writer and holy man, Tagore, had a school. Gandhi met him there in 1915 when he visited the school. The students played music and danced. They wore flowers and they didn't do much work. Life at the school was beautiful. Tagore gave his new friend a new name-""Mahatma Gandhi.""
After a year, Gandhi talked to Indian leaders. ""Wear Indian clothes-make jobs for Indians,"" he told them. ""Meet ordinary people. Speak their languages, not English. They don't understand English. They live in the country and they are poor. They don't go to school. We want to change India. First we have to understand the country and know the people.""
Gandhi started an ashram next to the Sabarmati River, near Ahmedabad. Money for the ashram came from rich families in Bombay and Ahmedabad. At the beginning, about thirty people lived there. Later, there were 230. Gandhi wanted to show India a simple way of life without machines.
There were many Hindus in India. But not all Hindus were the same. There were different classes. In the highest class were the holy men. Then there were the soldiers. Next came the farmers-this was Gandhi's class. And at the bottom, there were ""Untouchables."" They did the dirty jobs. They cleaned the streets. Other Hindus didn't want to talk to Untouchables.

"POSTCARDS 

Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. 
Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person’s visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.

"Careful! Fight with your head, don't fight with your heart, boy!' shouted Bowen.
The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings, princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. This was the Old Code. Life was good, and everybody in the country was happy. Then everything started to change and the peasants were angry. Bowen didn't like this. He loved Einon and he wanted the boy to remember the Old Code all his life.
After the sword-fighting lesson, Bowen and Einon sat down. 'Never turn your back to somebody when you fight, Einon! Why can't you remember that?'
Suddenly they heard the sound of a horse. They looked up and saw Brok, one of the king's knights, on his horse in front of them. Bowen didn't like Brok and looked at him angrily. Brok didn't live by the Old Code.
'We're fighting the peasants,' Brok told them. 'We're winning, of course. King Freyne wants his son to come and watch.'
'It's not good or clever to fight the peasants,' answered Bowen. He really hated Brok.
'They're stupid! The king says they have to die. He wants Einon to come now. And you too, Bowen,' Brok shouted. Then he turned his horse and rode away fast.
'Why did he shout at you?' asked Einon. 'You're a Knight of the Old Code! You're not afraid of him!'

"' My chain ? ' said Scrooge. ' What chain ? '
'You too are making a chain in your life,' said Marley's ghost. 'Your chain was as heavy and as long as this one when I died.'
'What? '
'And in the next seven years you made it heavier and longer.'
'Don't tell me more,' said Scrooge. ' I'm afraid. Make me happier. Talk about something different.'
' I can't,' the ghost answered. ' I can't stay here. I have to go to a new place, always a new place. In life I worked and worked. I was always in the office. I never stopped making money. But now I have to go to many sad places. Always a new place - every day, every minute.'
'Dead for seven years ! ' thought Scrooge. 'And never in one place ! '
'Yes, all the time,' said the ghost. ' I am always moving. Never happy. This time of the year is the worst. Why, in the past, did I turn my eyes away when I walked near people ? Why didn't I look at the poor homes? Why didn't I help poor people ? Listen to me ! '
' I will,' said Scrooge. ' I will ! But don't be angry with me ! '
' I sat next to you many times in the days after I died.'
This was not a nice thought for Scrooge. ' I am here tonight,'
the ghost said, 'because I have to tell you something. I can help you.'
'You were always a good friend to me,' said Scrooge. 'Thank you.'

"CANADA GEESE

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there.
Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.'
Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him.
When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home.
This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them.
When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him!",A2
"HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a beautiful village about fifty kilometres west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old.
When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty!
So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.",A2
"Stop the ship! This is too dangerous,"" Hayes said to Englehorn. ""We'll get out of here and find better weather,"" Englehorn said. ""How much water is under the
ship?"" he asked his sailors. Every man on the ship wanted an answer to that question. Englehorn and Hayes didn't know this way. Were they near rocks?
They hoped not. Suddenly, Jimmy screamed, ""Wall! There's a wall in front of us! We're going to sail into it!"" Englehorn shouted to Hayes, ""Stop the ship!""
Hayes quickly tried to stop it but the front of the ship hit the wall. ""Rocks!"" screamed Jimmy. Englehorn could do nothing now. The ship was in dangerous water and moved wildly up and down. Some sailors fell on the floor. Other men ran and shouted. They had to save their ship! Nobody wanted to die on these rocks. Suddenly, Carl could see Skull Island, a rocky mountain with very old ruins at the top. Its giant black rocks stood out of the water and they looked dangerous. 
 ""Here's the movie camera,"" said Preston to his boss, ready for a day's
work. The two men left quickly but nobody saw them. ""We're taking in a lot of water!"" Hayes shouted suddenly. The sailors worked quickly, but they didn't have much time. They had to get the water out of the ship. ""Come quick!"" Jimmy shouted to Englehorn. Englehorn and Hayes quickly followed Jimmy up the stairs and looked. Four sailors were in a small boat with Carl, Jack, Preston, and Ann.

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are quite near each other. On the road between them, there are a lot of green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to 
him is called Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think that it was a very long time ago. To get nearer the picture, you can walk from

"BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.,say the police.
Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window.
He went on to report that night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work.
Inspector Saunders said that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.'",A2

It was very strange, but the baby was now a pig.

After a night with friends in a bar, Obama Sr.'s car went off the road and into a tree. He died in Kenya at the age of forty-six.
Obama did not know his father very well and he did not feel very sad. But when he phoned his mother, she cried. A short time later, Obama's African sister, Auma, visited him in Chicago for the first time. She told her brother about their father's problems before he died. When she was young, his
job with the Kenyan government ended suddenly. He did not like some of the people with political power, and he told other people that. When the government took away his job, he started drinking in bars. His American wife left him and she took their two sons. He had almost no money.

At the age of 27, Obama began studying at Harvard Law School. He was a disciplined student, intelligent, and friendly with everybody. He told students, and teachers, his ideas for a better life for the country's poor people. Obama was older than most of the other students, and his teachers enjoyed their conversations with him. ""

"The History of Farming 

Before people started farming, they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and slowly their villages got bigger. 
Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and then some people did not get enough food to eat. 
Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.

"Dear Lorna,

How are you? I’m happy because last month I got a new job in the city centre. I am working in a Tourist Information Office and it is very interesting. I start work every morning at half past seven, so I have to get up very early! I love this job because I meet people from a variety of different countries. I like telling them about our city. Here is a photo of me. I’m wearing my new uniform. Do you like it?

"'You're going to go to England,' the oldest boy said to Mary. 'My
parents told me. You're going to live with your uncle. He lives in a house
in the country. He's a hunchback.'
Mary felt afraid when she heard this. That evening, Mrs Crawford
talked to her. 'You're going to go to England, my dear,' she said. 'You're
going to live with your uncle, Mr Archibald Craven, in Yorkshire.'
'Where's Yorkshire?' asked Mary.
'In the north-east of England,' answered Mrs Crawford.
She went to Mary and put her arms round her. But the child pulled
away from her. 'She's an ugly little thing,' Mrs Crawford thought.
Mary went to England with an English family. In London, one of Mr Craven's
servants met her. The servant's name was Mrs Medlock. She was a fat woman with
a red face and small black eyes. Mary did not like her and she did not like Mary.
They caught a train to Yorkshire.
Mary sat quietly and looked out of the window. She felt very unhappy.
'My mother and father didn't want me,' she thought. 'The Indian servants
didn't like me. Nobody likes me.' 
Nobody said to Mary, 'People don't like you because you aren't nice.'
So she didn't understand.
It was a long journey to Yorkshire. Mrs Medlock got bored and
started to talk. 'Mr Craven's house in Yorkshire is a strange place,' she
said. 'It's 600 years old and it's in the middle of the country. There are
100 rooms, but we don't use many of them. There are big gardens round
the house and tall old trees.'

29th August 2002

Dear John,
Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a very good teacher. I enjoyed my stay in Cambridge. 
Now I am staying at my brother’s flat. He is studying to be a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go home to Greece.
I like London very much. We travelled to Regents Park by bus yesterday. It was very sunny and we had a good time.
Tonight, I am going to see a film with my brother and some of his friends.
I’ll write again from Greece.
Best wishes,

"The airplane flew through a blue sky. Alan pulled his hat over his eyes and fell asleep. Hours later, he woke up and looked out the window. He could see Isla Sorna. It was very green.
The plane flew down to the island and suddenly Alan felt excited. ""Look!"" he said. There was a dinosaur on some open ground. ""It's an Apatosaur. Look at the colors.""
""That's wonderful,"" Billy said. ""Usually I only see bones. The colors look so strange.""
""Mr. and Mrs. Kirby!"" Alan called to the front of the plane. ""Look out the right. You can see-""
But they weren't interested. Alan looked at Billy. ""Strange,"" Billy said. ""I think they have a problem.""
Everybody was very quiet. One man flew the plane. A second man sat next to him. They weren't very friendly. A third man, in dark glasses, sat quietly at the back. Suddenly, the front of the plane went down.
""You're going down to the ground?"" Alan said, very afraid. Paul turned back to him. ""Dr. Grant, please don't move. I'll tell you all about this in a minute.""
""This plane cannot go down there!""
Alan got up from his chair and moved to the front. The man with dark glasses pulled him back. Alan started to fight but something hit him. His world went dark.
 ""ERIC! ERIC! Are you there, dear? Ben! Eric!"" Amanda Kirby shouted very loudly into the trees.
Alan opened his eyes. He was on the floor of the plane and his head hurt. Billy helped him to the door. The three men all had guns now. Alan felt very afraid. These guns couldn't stop dinosaurs.

"Piano players - when they were young

Ivan Petrov
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia, but from the age of twelve to eighteen he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. At ten, he decided that he wanted to write music too, and he soon started on his first song.
Oleg Gagarin
Oleg was the youngest of five children and when he was four years old his father, who liked playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. When he was six, he started having lessons with a piano teacher who lived in the same city. Oleg soon began to win prizes for his piano playing. At the age of fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Later, he returned home to Russia.
Josef Heptmann
Josef‘s father was German but he taught music in Poland where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and a year later he started playing the piano.
He gave his first concert when he was six. At ten, he gave fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef always liked music but he was also interested in physics and languages. He is too busy now but one day he would like to write his own music.",A2
"John Pickering

In a park in a small town in central England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers. But all last week he was in Tokyo and millions of Japanese people watched the thirty-five-year-old gardener on television because John is the number one singer in Japan at the moment. John visited Japan a few months ago to sing in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on his radio show. Hundreds of young people phoned the radio and asked the disc jockey to play the songs once more.
John, who uses the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, is not going to stop working in the park in England. He does not know yet how much he will earn from his music. 'I must keep my job in the park,' he says. 'I still have to pay my bills!' The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan. They've never even heard him sing.
John's wife, Denise, a hospital worker, says, 'This will not change the way we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!'",A2
"'What did you talk about when the ghost was in your room?' asked Wish. 'Did he tell you about his life?' asked Sanderson. We wanted to know more about our friend's visitor. We started to believe Clayton too. 
It was only a story when he started, and Clayton told very good stories. But now it was more than that. We believed it. 'And when did he die?' Evans asked. 'Only last month. He's a new ghost, and not very good at it. He doesn't understand much about haunting.' 'How did he die?' 
'That,' said Clayton, 'is the most interesting thing about him. He worked as an English teacher in a London boys' school. He lived in a small room in the school. Some of the boys also lived there. One night, he heard a sound. ""I never slept well,"" he said. ""When I heard a small sound, my eyes always opened again."" He took a candle and went downstairs, to the school office. There was an old gas fire in the room. The fire wasn't lit, and there was gas in the room. His candle lit the gas. There was a very loud noise ... and then a fire started. He died in the fire.' 
'That was a very bad end to his life,' Wish said. 'And the schoolboys? What happened to them?' I asked. 'They were all right. Somebody saw the fire and put it out. It didn't go up to the bedrooms. But it was too late for my ghost.'

"Snowboarding

Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding at 20. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her when she was at a snowboarding competition last week in Switzerland and asked her why she started the sport.
'I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.'
We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. 'Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.'
We asked her what is important when you're learning. 'You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!'",A2
"That night, it rained heavily. Mary woke up and could not sleep again. Suddenly, she sat up in bed. 'It's that sound again!' she thought. She left her room and walked through the dark house. 
Sometimes she stopped and listened. She came to a door with a light under it. 'The sound's coming from here,' she thought. 'And I met Mrs Medlock here before!' Slowly she opened the door. She saw a room with a large bed in it. There was a boy in the bed. 
He was about ten years old and he had a thin, white face and big, grey eyes. He did not see Mary and she watched him for a short time. He cried and then stopped. Then he cried again. He looked tired and ill. 
Mary walked into the room. The boy turned and saw her. 'Who are you?' he asked. He looked very afraid. 'I'm Mary Lennox,' the little girl answered. 'Mr Craven's my uncle.' 'He's my father,' said the boy. 'I'm Colin Craven.' 'Your father!' cried Mary. 'I didn't know about you!' 
'Come here,' said Colin. Mary went and stood near his bed. 'Where did you come from?' he asked. 'My room,' said Mary. 'My parents died and I live here now. Didn't they tell you about me?' 'No,' Colin answered. 'They know that I don't want to see people. And I don't like people seeing me.' 'Why not?' asked Mary. The boy did not speak for a minute.

"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice.
Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish. is easy,' he says. 'First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here!'",A2
"In the night E.T. looked up from his bed in the closet, and saw Elliott climb out the window. ""Where is he going?"" E.T. thought. He didn't want to think about that, so he put his head down again.

the forest. Their lights shone in the night sky. ""Harvey,"" Elliott said quietly, ""we have something wonderful with us. Do you know that? I love him, Harvey."" He looked up at the sky. Which star did his new friend come from? His little eyes shone and they looked carefully at Elliott. Lance knew something, and Elliott was afraid. Elliott and Michael walked to school. 
""We have to tell, Elliott,"" Michael said. ""No,"" Elliott answered. ""He wants to stay with us. Michael, listen, there are some strange people around here now. I don't know them. Look at that car. There's a man inside it and he's reading a newspaper. Why is he there? What's he waiting for? I think they're looking for E.T.""
Elliott was very unhappy. ""Michael,"" he said, ""we can't tell, or he won't get back home. I know it-I can feel it inside me."" Greg, Tyler, and Steve were at the bus stop. ""Elliott, what happened to your 'little man' in the yard? Did he come

'Good afternoon,' said the man in the shop.
'Good afternoon,' said Mr Brown. 'Can I look round the shop?'
'Please do.'
Mr Brown looked at the things in the shop. He saw an old doll with a sad face. It wasn't a pretty face, but Mr Brown liked it. The doll was a little old man with white hair and black clothes.
Mr Brown thought, 'Perhaps the doll is lonely, too.' He asked, 'How much do you want for this old doll?'
The man thought. 'Oh, that. Three pounds,' he said.
Mr Brown wanted the doll. Why? He didn't know. But he wanted it. Three pounds was a lot of money for an old doll, but Mr Brown paid it. He went out with the doll in his hand. He looked at its face. 'Is it smiling?' he wondered. 'No,' he thought. 'It's only a doll.' He said to it, 'I'm going to take you home.'
The doll didn't answer - it was only a doll. So why did Mr Brown speak to it? Because he was lonely. He put it in his case with his papers from the office.
Mr Brown was tired now, so he got on the bus. The man came for Mr Brown's money and Mr Brown bought a ticket. Suddenly, somebody on the bus spoke. 'Go away!' said the person. 'You stupid man. Go away!'

But she couldn't stand up and the other dogs attacked her again and again. Buck couldn't move. Dogs in California never fought in this way. He looked at Spitz, and Spitz laughed. Then Frank jumped into the center of the crazy dogs and hit them with his club. He and three other men with clubs quickly moved the dogs away. 
It all happened very fast, but in those two minutes Curly was dead. Buck never forgot this attack. Spitz looked at Buck and he laughed again. From that time, Buck hated Spitz more than anything in life. But then Buck had another surprise. Frank put a harness on him. 
""I know you don't like this, Buck,"" said Frank. ""I know it's new and strange for you. But you have to wear it. Then you can pull the sledge."" 
Buck didn't like this new thing around his neck, and he didn't like pulling the sledge. But Frank hit him when he did something wrong. And Spitz attacked him when he didn't run very fast. 
Frank shouted, ""Mush!"" and Buck had to run quickly. He then shouted, ""Ho!"" and Buck had to stop. In this way, Buck learned to pull the sledge. 
""These are very good dogs,"" Frank said to Perrault, ""Buck pulls very hard and he learns very quickly.""

suit of armour next to the door again and watched it carefully.  But half an hour later, another man arrived with his donkeys.

"I pulled my woolen hat down tighter and enjoyed the smell of wood and smoke from the small fire in front of me. I was back in Nepal after almost a year, and I felt good. The quietness of the Himalayan morning was very different from the noise and dirty air of Beijing. 
I was now living in Beijing, and I was a business director for Microsoft in China. I was excited by my new job, but there were already problems with life in Beijing. The city was very cold and there was no space in the city for running or cycling, and I had a bad cough from the unclean air. 
But this morning in Nepal I felt good. After breakfast, my father and I continued to climb up the narrow path to Bahundanda. We were followed by eight yaks, each one with a big box of books on its back, and their driver. The sun was hot as we climbed the steep path. The yaks were a long way behind us, so I stopped at a small river. 
As I was washing my face, someone sat next to me. I looked up and saw a young Nepalese man. He was drinking from the icy water. ""Namaste,"" he greeted me with a very friendly smile. ""Kasto Cha,"" I replied. (""How are you?"")

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died.
The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds.
Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also it could run fast because it had long back legs.",A2

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she went up the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London.
In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. 'You must carry everything on your back,' she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!'

The man stopped. For a minute he looked down at me carefully. (We look at a small animal in the same way, and think: 'Will it hurt me? ') Then he took me up in his fingers and put me about three metres from his eyes. I was about twenty metres from the ground, so I was afraid.
'Perhaps he'll throw me down onto the ground and put his foot on me,' I thought. 'In our country, we sometimes do that to animals.'
I put my hands up. I wanted to say, ' Please don't kill me! ' and 'Your fingers are hurting me ! '

I spoke to the farmer. He put me next to his ear - about two metres away - but he could not understand me. He answered me, and the noise was as loud as a lot of big guns. I could not
understand his words.
The farmer carried me carefully to his house. It was time for the midday meal. His wife cried loudly when she saw me. Women in England do this when they see a rat. Then she began to like me.
She cut up some bread and meat for me. I smiled - ' Thank you' - and took out my knife.

"The Globe Theatre 

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen loved going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. The visitors ate, talked to their friends, walked about during the show, and some people even threw things at the actors! 
Today, it is still possible to visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre stands in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.

"It was 1814. Louis 18th was King of France and the ex-emperor Napoleon was in exile on the island of Elba in the Mediterranean. A young sailor on a French ship, Edmond Dantes, was in Elba and agreed to take a secret letter from Napoleon to his supporters in France. 
After Edmond returned to his home city of Marseilles, a royal judge found out about the letter. Then, on the day of Edmond's wedding to his beautiful girlfriend, Mercedes, the king's soldiers came to his house and arrested him. a 
From the boat, Edmond saw the Chateau d'If. 'No prisoners ever leave that terrible castle alive!' he thought. The guards put Edmond into a small, dark underground cell. Days, weeks and months passed and Edmond was afraid of going mad. 
Then, one evening he heard a noise under the floor. Suddenly, a hole appeared and an old man climbed out of a tunnel. 'Hello, my name is Faria,' he said. 
The two men soon became very good friends. Faria was a wise priest and taught Edmond a lot about languages and science. When Faria became very ill, Edmond looked after him and saved his life. Later, Faria told Edmond about some fantastic treasure on the small island of Monte Cristo. 
When Faria died a few years later, the guards put his body into a bag. This gave Edmond a good idea. 'Only dead people leave this prison!' He opened the bag with Faria's knife, took the body to his cell and put it in his bed. After that, he got into the bag and waited patiently.

Colin: That's right! If I had a job, I wouldn't have time to watch lots of reality shows.
I : Oh, I see. Okay. We'd like to ask you a few questions. In our programme, a group of young people spend three
months on a desert island.
C: Sounds great!
I: Well ... You won't have MP3 players, mobiles, books or ... food! So, first question: How would you get fresh water?
C: Erm ... I suppose I'd find a stream. I: Imagine there is no stream!
C: Oh, I don't know ... erm ... If there wasn't a stream, I would drink sea water.
I: Sea water ... hmm. And what about food?
C: If there were trees, I'd look for fruit. And if there was no forest, I could catch fish and cook it on the fire. My
granddad taught me to catch fish. 
I: How would you make the fire if you didn't have any matches?
C: No problem! I'd use dry wood. If I wasn't a boy scout I wouldn't know how to make a fire. I've been a scout
since I was ten, you see.
I: Right. And do you know how to make a shelter?
C: No, not really. But I wouldn't need any shelter if I was on a tropical island! It's nice and warm there, isn't it?

"Barbara (born 1935)
I was born before World War II and politics has always been important in my life. My grandfather died in the war in 1943. My aunt spent years in a communist prison in the 1950s. In the 1970s and 1980s my family fought for democracy in my country. My granddaughter, Maria, has always lived in a democratic country. She has grown up with shops full of nice things and has never seen a queue longer than ten people, except outside a club! We have been very close since she was born in 1989 - she is a great girl, she helps me a lot and she has taught me to use the internet .
Maria (born 1989)
My granny has had an amazing life. She's like living history: she's seen three political systems, a world war and a revolution. Since 1989, she has worked for the government.
She is not really into music or fashion - she's never had fashionable clothes. She has always been interested in technology - she has had a computer for years, she surfs the internet and emails her friends.
My granny has been my best friend for my whole life. I never argue with her. She tells me incredible stories from the past and I tell her things that I never tell my parents.

"Tired of the rain and mud, high prices and queues at the big British rock festivals like Reading or Glastonbury? Want to combine a festival with some sun and fun abroad? Tim Hughes checks out three of Europe's biggest and best festivals.

The hot, sandy one
Where: In Benicassim on the Mediterranean Coast between Barcelona and Valencia .
When: 16-19 July
What music: A big variety of pop, indie rock and electronic music. You can find big names like Oasis, Franz Ferdinand and Leonard Cohen.
Who goes: More than half the audience are foreigners and most of these are Brits in their twenties.
FIB (Festival Internacional de Benicassim) started in 1995 and has got larger every year. The music goes on until 8.00 in the morning so you can party all night and then chill out on the beach. It's VERY hot but is definitely worth going to. It's like a big UK festival on a beach with nice weather.

The big party one    
Where:  In a historic fortress on the Danube in Novi Sad in northern Serbia.    
When:  9-12 August   
What music:  Some big names like The Prodigy and Moby. Twenty-five stages with everything from rock to reggae and from blues to chill-out.      
Who goes:  Most people are local but more foreigners come every year.   
EXIT  was started by three university students in 2000. Every year there's a social theme (this year it's the environment). We recommend the fantastic atmosphere, the dance arena for 20,000 people and the parties on the banks of the Danube. Watch the sun come up in the morning - it looks amazing.

"An Australian teacher, Jason Cull, was swimming in the sea last week when a great white shark bit his leg. 'I hit its eye,' said Cull, 'and then it let go.' 
However, most people don't know how to react to a hungry shark and you don't want to give a four-metre shark more reasons to dislike you. But what about other animals? What is the best thing to do if one attacks you? 
When you meet an angry alligator, you should run away from it because alligators can't go very far on land. If it catches you, hit its eyes and nose. In 2006, Corey Workman of Florida did this and survived because he learnt the trick from Discovery Channel. 
Never run away from a big cat like a puma. Stand there, look at it directly and try to look big. Open your coat or stand on a rock, show your teeth and make aggressive noises. Prepare to fight back with a stick or rocks. You must act like the more aggressive predator. 
The general rule is: stay away from bears. They normally don't go near humans but if you come across a mother bear with cubs, she will probably attack you. Don't try to get away - bears can run fast and climb trees. Don't try to fight back. Some experts say you should 'play dead' but you have to be brave to do this!

"In 1878, Milton Wright gave his two sons, Wilbur and Orville, a toy helicopter. The boys loved playing with the helicopter and Wilbur and Orville soon began to make models. In 1892, the brothers started a bicycle workshop. In their workshop, they experimented with a model aeroplane. 
In November 2008, a bag was lost in space by astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, during repairs outside the International Space Station . The incident was reported by the media all over the world.
In fact, this happens quite a lot. A glove was lost during the US astronauts' first spacewalk in 1965 and a camera disappeared in space during the Gemini 10 mission in 1966. These objects in space are called space junk.
There is a lot of junk in our solar system. It is found on Venus and Mars and twenty tons of it have been left by Americans on the Moon since the first Moon landing! Since 1957, when the first satellite, Sputnik , was launched by the Soviet Union, more than 4000 satellites have been sent into orbit. So it isn't surprising that some rubbish has been left behind!
Space junk travels as fast as 36,000 kilometres per hour and is very dangerous for space craft. and satellites. Space Shuttle windows are often damaged and have been replaced over eighty times so far!
A lot of work is needed to clean up the space junk. Who knows, 'space junk collector' may be an important job in the future!

"What will be the main threats to our health in the 21st century?
The climate is getting warmer and bugs love high temperatures so they are going to spread faster than ever. For example, tropical diseases, like malaria, may move into colder regions. Also, I'm certain that new diseases will appear, like Bird Flu (H5N1) and Swine Flu (H1N1). And there may be another global threat like AIDS soon.
But we have vaccines and drugs ...
The problem is that we have over-used antibiotics in the last fifty years. Many diseases, like tuberculosis, have become resistant to our drugs so it is going to be really difficult to treat infectious diseases. And vaccines may not work because bugs change quickly. Flu is a good example of that.
Does pollution create any health threats?
Oh, yes. Pollution causes allergies and serious problems like asthma. And I'm sure more allergies will develop because pollution won't disappear in the near future.
What problems does our lifestyle cause?
Well, I think the most serious threat is obesity. Twenty percent of British kids are obese and because of that, they are going to have all sorts of health problems, such as diabetes.
Is there any good news?
Oh, yes. Today, we live thirty years longer than a hundred years ago and I'm sure modern medicine will help us live even longer.

"It's Saturday afternoon in Birmingham city centre and young people are buying the latest fashions. But one young woman is not with the crowd . She is looking for bargains in a small charity shop. 
'I hate paying a lot for clothes,' says Helen Howard, a student at Birmingham University. 'In the past, people thought I was mean but now it's cool to be frugal. People have less money these days and they're worried about the environment. You can get great bargains in charity shops or at the sales. I bought this Versace top for o4.50 and these Diesel jeans for o5.' 
Helen is typical of the new attitude to money and even Hollywood stars are doing it. 
'I love going to markets and second-hand clothes shops to look for things,' says Kiera Knightley. Angelina Jolie wore a $26 vintage dress at a recent . lm premiere and does not use expensive face creams. 'The main thing is to get enough sleep and drink lots of water,' she says. 
According to Helen, there are lots of fun ways to save money. 
'For example, have a party and swap clothes, CDs, computer games and books with your friends or sell your old things online. Walk or cycle to school and go to the library to get books and DVDs. One bit of advice is to celebrate Valentine's Day on 15 February. A bouquet of roses, a box of chocolates or a bottle of perfume is up to half price the day after!'

"Most of us have very ordinary daily lives. We get up at the usual time, spend hours at school or work and come home at the same time every evening. In his book on English eccentrics, Henry Hemming looks at unusual people with very different lives from ours. 
According to Hemming, eccentrics are not mad; they see the world differently from us, have their own personal timetables and are not worried about people's opinions of them. 3 In his book, Hemming looks at our national tradition of eccentrics and meets lots of different eccentric people. He interviews a professional boxer in aristocratic clothes, an adventurous inventor, a successful fashion designer and a famous rock musician.
Hemming finds people like Tom Leppard, the Leopard Man. Ninety-two percent of his body has tattoos. Tom lives alone on a beautiful , windy Scottish island in a cabin. He does not need a watch or a clock because he has no obligations. He gets up and goes to bed when he wants to. 'I can do what I like and when I like,' he says. 'And that is paradise.' On a typical day, Tom feeds the birds or goes for a swim in the sea. Every two weeks he goes to town in his kayak. He goes to the bank, gets food and then goes back home. Tom is a hermit 'but I never get lonely here,' he says. 
Hemming's favourite eccentric is the friendly John Rothwell, now called King Arthur after the sixth century British king. 'King Arthur' does not work and has no routine or typical day. He rides around Britain on his motorbike and campaigns to save historic monuments and trees.

"Up to two million tourists have come to Pamplona this weekend for the San Fermin festival . They will spend a lot of money in Pamplona's restaurants over the next week . The famous bull runs are the highlight of the festival. 
Runners wear white shirts and trousers and red scarves. They run 840 metres with six dangerous, 500-kilogram bulls . They cannot carry any objects except newspapers. They have to run really fast and often have no time to escape the bull. 
I spoke to Tom Barnes, who has come to Pamplona with a few friends. 'We just want to have some fun' , he says. 'Do we have any experience of bull runs? No, but we're quite fit, so, with a little luck , there won't be any trouble. I know some bulls can be dangerous but I'm sure we'll be okay.' 
Every year, between 200 and 300 people get injured, some of them seriously, and thirteen people have died over the last 100 years. There are also a lot of protests from animal rights activists but there are no signs that the fiesta will end.  

We're organising a party to celebrate spring. We're raising money for musical instruments.
The party is at the College Sports Hall at 8 p.m. on 23 March .

"Vic Armstrong is afraid of nothing. He has fallen out of windows, jumped off bridges, ridden a motorcycle through fire, climbed up the outside of a skyscraper and driven into a wall - because that's his job. 
Vic is a stunt double in films and does things that most of us think are crazy. Vic was Harrison Ford's stunt double in all three early Indiana Jones films. He has also worked on many James Bond films including Die Another Day. 'A job on a Bond film is the most fun for a stuntman - I try out the cars,' says Vic. 
His most famous stunt was when he jumped from a horse onto a German tank in one of the Indiana Jones films. Movie viewers voted this 'one of the ten best stunts of all time'. 
Vic has broken some bones, but he says that it's part of the job. He now spends more time as a stunt director, directing other stuntmen. In 2002 he worked on Gangs of New York with one of his favourite directors, Martin Scorsese. Vic says it was 'great fun'. 
Now, after forty years of stunt work, the man without fear feels the same way. Vic still thinks it's the best job in the world: 'I enjoy my work now as much as when I started,' he says. 'And now, as a stunt director, I tell other people to fall and jump. And the money is very, very good.'

"OZBUS is the longest bus ride in the world and the ultimate journey for backpackers. In twelve weeks it travels 16,000 kilometres through twenty different countries.
'Most people fly from London to Sydney at 40,000 feet and never see anything,' says Mark Creasey from Ozbus. 'On the Ozbus people can see the most beautiful places in the world. We go across Europe, through Turkey, India, China, Malaysia and Australia. We travel through deserts, mountains and jungles - it's amazing.'
Jeff Lane travelled on the Ozbus last summer. 'The best thing was the Taj Mahal,' he said. 'The most exciting place was the tiger reserve in the Himalayas, and I really enjoyed visiting the base camp of Mount Everest.' And what were the worst things? 'Well, in Tehran the bus broke down and we waited a whole day for a new one. That wasn't so good. And I didn't always enjoy camping at night. Sometimes I wanted to stay somewhere more comfortable!'
The Ozbus takes up to forty people of all ages. At night, the passengers usually stay in camps or sometimes in small hotels. Everyone takes turns to buy food in local markets and cook for the group.
The greatest journey in the world? Creasey thinks so: 'If you want a truly awesome experience, then the Ozbus is for you.'

Jean from France: 'You should drink lots of water and get lots of sleep. Nothing else helps.'
Sun-Do from Korea: 'We eat kimchi - a dish made from cabbage. You should try it. The cabbage is full of vitamin C and the spices in kimchi also help.'
Sam from South Africa: 'No medicine - you shouldn't take antibiotics for a cold - that's crazy. Your body can fight the cold virus.'
Ana-Maria from Spain: 'You should eat fruit, lots of it, especially things like oranges.'
Mary from Scotland: 'You should drink herbal tea with honey and lemon in it and you should relax. You shouldn't go to work.'
Doug from the USA: 'That's easy. You should have a bowl of my grandmother's chicken soup. That's the perfect cure. I don't care what anybody says - there's nothing better.'

Number Seventeen is the smallest house in the street. The Banks live in this house. They are six - Mr. and Mrs. Banks and their four children - Jane, Michael and the twins - Barbara and John. Mrs. Banks has a lot of housework and she has a nurse to help with the children. But one day their nurse left them and Mrs. Bank didn't know what to do.

""But, professor, you must eat!"" The professor looked excited.
""Martha, food is not important."" Then he turned to me. ""Axel, come with me.""
He took me into his library. It was a big room with lots of bookcases against the walls and heavy velvet curtains in front of the windows. In the middle of the room, there was a desk where my uncle spent most of his evenings.
He took an old book out of his coat pocket. He looked at me.
""Axel, look at this! Look at this!""
I took it from his hand. Its cover was hard and it looked very old.
""Why, what is it professor?""
""I found it today in an old bookshop. It's seven hundred years old.""

"My name is Doctor Watson. I am writing this story about my friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective.
Sherlock Holmes lives at 221B Baker Street, in the middle of London. My story begins in Baker Street, one morning in 1889, when a man knocked on the door.
I heard the man say, 'Mr Holmes? My name is Dr Mortimer. I need your help.'
'Come in,' said Holmes. 'How can I help you?' 'I have a strange story to tell you, Mr Holmes,' said Dr Mortimer. 'My story is very strange. Perhaps you will not believe me.'
Dr Mortimer sat down. Sherlock Holmes and I listened to his story.
'I am a doctor and I work in the country,' said Dr Mortimer. 'I live and work on Dartmoor. And, as you know, Dartmoor is a large, wild place. There is only one big house on Dartmoor - Baskerville Hall. The owner of the house was Sir Charles Baskerville. I was his friend as well as his doctor.'
'I read of his death in The Times newspaper,' said Holmes.
'That was three months ago,' said Dr Mortimer. The newspaper reported his death, but it did not report all the facts.'
'Was there something strange about his death?' asked Sherlock Holmes.
'I am not certain,' said Dr Mortimer. 'There was a story about a curse on the Baskerville family. Sir Charles believed this old story.'
'A curse?' I asked. 'What do you mean?'
'Here is the story,' said Dr Mortimer. He took a large piece of paper out of his pocket. 'Please read this. It is the story of the Curse of the Baskervilles.'

"Something very strange was happening to me. My head hurt, I didn't know where I was. I couldn't remember my name. I couldn't remember anything.
My eyes were closed. I tried to think. Where was I? Who was I? Someone spoke to me.
'Are you all right?' a voice asked.
I opened my eyes. It was evening and almost dark. I was sitting on a long, wooden bench in a park. A teenage boy was standing in front of me. The boy had a dog with him. I couldn't see any other people. Everywhere was quiet.
'Are you all right?' the boy repeated. 'You look strange.'
I felt strange. I sat up straight. My whole body hurt. 'What happened to me?' I asked. 'Did I have an accident?'
'I don't know,' the boy said. 'I saw you walk here and sit down.'
'I walked here!' I said, surprised.
'Yes, can't you remember? It was about five minutes ago.'
I couldn't remember anything. The boy pointed behind me. 'You came from over there,' he said.
I turned and looked where the boy was pointing. I could see some trees. Beyond the trees, a train passed by slowly.
'What's over there?' I asked.
'There's only the railway line,' the boy replied. 'But that's where you came from.'
'What place is this?' I asked.
The boy laughed. 'What do you mean?' he said. 'Don't you know?'
I didn't know.
'This is Nuneaton,' the boy said. He laughed again.
I repeated the name of the town to myself. The boy stood looking at me. My clothes were dirty. My jacket was torn.

"It was the year 1757. The place was the dangerous and wild land, west of the Hudson River. It was the third year of the war in North America. The war was between England and France. Each country wanted the land for itself.
Indian tribes had always lived in that land. In the war, some tribes were fighting for the French. Other tribes were fighting for the English.
Fort Edward was on the Hudson River. General Webb was the commander of the English army at Fort Edward. He was waiting for news of General Montcalm. Montcalm was the commander of the French army.
The news came one morning. An Indian called Magua arrived.
'Montcalm and the French army are coming towards Fort William Henry,' Magua told General Webb.
Fort William Henry was fifteen miles away. It was at the south end of Lake Horican.
'How many men has Montcalm got?' asked Webb.
'As many as the leaves on the trees,' said Magua. 'General Munro wants more soldiers at Fort William Henry.'
'I will send fifteen hundred men,' said General Webb.
General Munro was the commander of the English army at Fort William Henry. He had two daughters - Cora and Alice. Cora was about twenty-three years old and Alice was eighteen. Cora had dark hair and a beautiful face, Alice had fair hair and blue eyes.
These two young women were at Fort Edward. But they were going to travel to Fort William Henry. They were going to meet their father.
General Webb spoke to Cora and Alice.

"In September, 1864, delegates or representatives from the maritime colonies (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island) and the United Province of Canada (Canada East and Canada West) met in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island to talk about uniting under one central government. This meeting is called the Charlottetown Conference. John A. Macdonald, George Etienne Cartier, and George Brown tried to persuade the representatives of the maritime colonies that they should all join together in a federal union under one central government. After a lot of eating and drinking, the delegates agreed. They decided to meet again in Quebec to talk about how this federal union would work.
On October 9, 1864, delegates from the maritime colonies and the United Province of Canada had a second meeting in Quebec City. They talked about how Canada would be governed under a federal union. John A. Macdonald presented a list called the Seventy Two Resolutions. This list was a set of rules for governing the new country. Macdonald persuaded the majority of delegates to agree with these rules.
The delegates had to persuade the rest of the people to agree with the rules also. There were many debates or discussions to allow the people to say how they felt. Finally, there was a vote in the Legislative Assembly in each colony and province. The United Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick voted for Confederation. However, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland chose not to join the new union at this time.",A2
"The South continued to try to get Britain into the war. Confederate agents living in Canada began to make raids or short attacks across the U. S. border. The most famous raid was in St. Albans, Vermont on October 19, 1864. The North was not happy with how Canada was dealing with the problem. The Civil War ended in 1865. The North won the war against the South. The people of BNA were afraid that a Union army would soon attack Canada. 
Instead of an American army, the Fenians crossed the border in 1866 and began to attack towns in British North America. The Fenians were a group of Irish terrorists who wanted to free Ireland from British rule. Many of them had fought for the Union in the American Civil War. They had learned to use guns and plan attacks. They thought their attacks on British North America would make Britain take her soldiers out of Ireland to defend her colonies in British North America.
Also in 1866, the Reciprocity Treaty between BNA and the United States ended. The United States no longer wanted free trade with BNA. The colonies would have to trade more with one another. However, there was no railway linking the colonies. A railway should be built to increase trade and move soldiers to where they were needed.
These events made more people in British North America think that Confederation would be a good idea. Government representatives decided to meet to talk about a plan.",A2
"Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC.
Thebes was the city of Imhotep, the High Priest of the Dead. It was also the city of Anck-su-namun. Anck-su-namun was the Pharaoh's lover. But she loved Imhotep.
Imhotep walked into her bedroom and took the beautiful woman in his arms.
""My love for you is more important than life,"" he said.
Outside the bedroom door, Imhotep’s priests watched. But when Pharaoh Seti the First of Egypt walked in, they couldn't stop him.
Imhotep quickly ran into the next room. Pharaoh Seti heard something, but he didn't see him.
""Who was here?"" Seti asked Anck-su-namun. ""I know somebody was here, in your bedroom.""
And then, the Pharaoh looked into the next room.
""Imhotep!"" he said. ""My High Priest!""
Anck-su-namun looked at Imhotep. They had to kill the Pharaoh before the Pharaoh and his soldiers killed them. Anck-su-namun took her knife and pushed it hard into the Pharaoh's back. The Pharaoh's eyes opened wide. Then, Imhotep took the Pharaoh's sword and killed him.
They heard something outside. The Pharaoh's soldiers - the Med-Jai - were there. But Imhotep's priests came in first. They took the Pharaoh's sword from Imhotep's hand.
""Come with us,"" the priests said to him. ""Quick."" They pulled him away from his lover.
""No!"" said Imhotep. ""I will stay with Anck-su-namun.""
""Please go,"" said Anck-su-namun. ""Please live. They will kill me, but you can bring me back to life. Only you, the High Priest, can do it.""

"I don't usually pick up hitch-hikers, but this one was different. He wasn't young, like the others, and he didn't have a bag, or a girlfriend, or a sign with 'London' or 'Lancaster' on it. He just stood there, beside the road, with his hand out, waiting. He was a man about forty years old, in a grey suit and red tie. He was just watching the cars and waiting.
He was watching me while I slowed down. I remember his eyes. Very pale blue eyes, staring at me through thin gold glasses. They looked surprised. Perhaps I was something strange, something not quite real to him. Or perhaps he just had bad eyes. Perhaps he couldn't see very well.
I stopped the car and opened the window. 'Where are you going?' I asked.
'I'm going into town,' he said. 'Into Lancaster. Could you give me a lift, please?'
'Yes, OK,' I said. 'I'm going that way. Jump in.'
He got in and sat down beside me. 'Thank you very much,' he said. 'It's very kind of you.'
'That's all right,' I said. 'It's my pleasure.'
I started the car and thought about the words he had used. There was something strange about them. Hitch-hikers don't usually speak like that. They usually say something like 'Are you going to Lancaster? Oh good, thanks a lot'. He spoke politely, like an older man. But this man wasn't very old. 'Perhaps he's foreign,' I thought.
I looked at him, and noticed something else.
'Could you put your seat-belt on, please?' I said.

"James Conway put away his business papers and sat back in his seat. He looked out of the aeroplane window down at the warm blue sea below. Far away, in the bright sun, there were the long white beaches of the island of Haiti. Behind them, he could just see the small wooden houses and the deep green leaves of the coconut trees, which were moving lazily in the soft afternoon wind.
'It looks beautiful, doesn't it?' Conway looked at the woman sitting next to him. 'Very nice,' he answered.
'Is this your first visit to Haiti?' the woman asked.
'Yes, but I'm not here as a visitor,' said Conway. 'I have a building company - it's called Conway Construction. My company has offices all over the world - America, Europe, Africa. We're very big in Australia too - everyone in Australia has heard the name Conway. I'm coming to get an office here, buy some land, build a few hotels, you know. The land is very cheap here - you can buy a piece of land to build a small town on, for a few thousand dollars. Sorry, I don't know your name. I'm Mr Conway, James Conway. Just call me Conway.'
'I'm Karen Jackson.'
'Nice to meet you, Karen. What do you do? Have you got a job, or are you married?'
'I'm at Harvard University.'

"My name is Carol Sanders.
I live in England now, but when I was younger, I lived in Hong Kong. My father was a businessman there and my mother worked as a secretary. We lived in Hong Kong for seven years.
I was happy at school, with lots of friends, and we had a good time. I liked pop music - the Rolling Stones, David Bowie and Jake Rosso were my favorites.
Jake Rosso was my favourite singer. He died in a car accident the year I left school, but I listened to his pop records all the time. I had hundreds of pictures and photos of him on my bedroom wall.
Then one day in winter when I was seventeen, things began to go wrong for me.
My father went to Australia on business. I loved him very much and didn't like him going away.
'Come home quickly,' I always said to him.
He was in Australia for two weeks. Then, on the day of his journey home, an aeroplane from Sydney crashed into the sea just south of Hong Kong. Everybody on the plane died.
I heard about the plane crash on television. At first, I did not think about my father. Then I remembered he was flying back from Sydney on that day.
'Oh, no!' I cried.
I telephoned the airport but they did not know the names of all the passengers then.
'Perhaps my father didn't get that plane,' I thought. 'Oh, please! Please!'
My mother was at work and I called her on the telephone. She came home quickly and we went to the airport and waited for news.

"It was a wonderful September day in Miami, Florida. On the wide white beach along the coast of Key Biscayne the sun was hot on the sand.
A slim young woman in her early twenties was lying alone down by the sea. She was beautiful, but her face was sad. Her long black hair fell over the book she was reading. From time to time she looked up from her book and along the beach. Then she put her book away in a bag and sat up. She looked unhappily along the beach again.
""I can't tell him! I just can't tell him!"" she whispered to herself.
The sea was flat, calm, and clear. And the weather was hot. It was too hot to work, too hot to play, too hot to drive into Miami to meet up with friends, and it was too hot to stay at home. The wide green streets of Key Biscayne and the parking lots of the tall white buildings were almost empty in the burning sun.
Everybody was at the beach. Groups of friends lay on the sand, talking, laughing and listening to music. Some were playing ball games, others ran into the water to swim. Families with fat babies and sunburned children lay under the palm trees that grew along the beach. Mothers watched carefully as their children ran down to the sea to play in the warm shallow water. And at the far end of the beach, across the water, the tall white buildings of Miami stood out against the clear blue sky.

"Billy, a young man from London, had no job. He lived with his mother, Mrs Harris. One day he asked her, 'How can I get a job?'
'Look in the newspaper,' she answered. So he bought a paper and looked for jobs.
There were a lot of jobs in London. He read the paper from front to back but most of them were not right for him. Suddenly he saw a good job in an office so he wrote a letter to the boss of the office and sent it. A week later he got a letter from the boss, Mr Davidson. He showed the letter to his mother: 'Please come to my office next Monday. I want to meet you and we can talk about the job.' Mrs Harris was quite excited and Billy was happy - but he was also very nervous.
On the Monday morning Billy got up early and had breakfast. He left the house and went to Mr Davidson's office. There were seven people there for one job. Mr Davidson asked him to come into his office and the other six people waited outside. He asked Billy a lot of questions - he was nervous and he answered the questions badly. When Mr Davidson finished he smiled at Billy and said, 'Thank you, Mr Harris. Please wait outside.'
Billy thought, 'I didn't answer all those questions very well.'
He stood up and walked to the door... but he made a mistake. It wasn't the door out of the office - it was a cupboard!
'What can I do now? Do I stay in the cupboard and wait or do I go back into the office?' he thought. 'Perhaps I'll stay here and wait. When they're all gone I can come out again.'

"It was a beautiful summer evening. Paul was happy. No more exams. College was finished. Now he needed a job. He wanted to be a writer and work for a newspaper. But first he needed a rest.
It was hot in the house. There was no wind.
I'll go for a walk, said Paul to himself. I'll go down to the river.
Paul lived in a small town and he was soon outside in the country. He walked near the river and watched the water birds.
Suddenly he saw the girl. She was standing alone, looking into the water. She was young, and very beautiful. She had long dark hair, and she was wearing a pretty white dress.
Paul went up to her.
'Hello,' he said.
'What's your name?'
'I'm Maria,' she said, and she smiled at him. Paul and Maria talked for a long time. The sun went down. It was nearly dark.
'I must go home,' said Maria.
'Where do you live?' asked Paul. 'In the big white house on the hill,' said Maria. 'Where do you live?'
'In the little brown house near the market,' said Paul. They laughed. But Paul was sad. The house on the hill was big and important. Maria was rich, and he was poor. And Paul was in love.
After that, Paul and Maria often met near the river. Maria always wore beautiful clothes. She always looked lovely. Paul thought about Maria all day and every day.

"In British Columbia, the population was very multicultural. Many Americans had come looking for gold. Now the gold rush was over and people were leaving. The government was deeply in debt. It had borrowed a lot of money to build roads. The Canadian government offered to make British Columbia a province and pay off its debts. It also promised to build a railway within the next ten years to link British Columbia to the rest of Canada. In 1871, British Columbia agreed and became the sixth province of Canada.
In the 1870s, the economy of Prince Edward Island was suffering. The Americans had ended the Reciprocity Treaty. Britain did not want them to make any more economic agreements with the United States. The government was also in debt because the railway across the island had cost a lot of money. There was another problem. All of the land on the island was owned by landowners who were never there. The farmers rented small areas of land from these absentee landlords. The farmers wanted to own the land but didn't have the money to buy it. The Canadian government made them an offer. It would buy all the land from the landlords, pay the Island’s debts, and give the Island a sum of money each year. It also promised to pay for a ferry and a telegraph cable to the mainland. On July 1, 1873, Prince Edward Island became the seventh –and smallest - province of Canada.
The Northwest Territories wanted to become one large province. The population there was growing quickly. In 1891, 100,000 people lived on the land between British Columbia and Manitoba. By 1914, the population was over one million people. They wanted to have the same rights as the other provinces of Canada.",A2
"Most animals can move freely from place to place. They can also move different parts of their bodies. Plants do not move from place to place, but some of their parts can move slowly. The leaves and flowers of many plants turn to face the sun every day. Buds open and flowers open and close.  Roots, stems and branches grow out in different directions.
Animals eat plants or other animals to stay alive. Plants also need food, but they make their own. To make food, the leaves take in carbon dioxide gas from the air, and the roots take in water and other materials from the soil.
All living things produce young ones of their own kind. This is called reproduction. Some animals reproduce by laying eggs but others produce live young. Many plants make seeds or spores from which young plants grow. In other cases, new plants may grow from the roots or stems of a parent plant.
All living things need oxygen from the air, as well as food, to obtain energy. This process is called respiration. We can see part of this process in many animals when they breathe.  But in some animals, and all plants, it is much harder to observe. (We will study respiration in Chapter 6).
All living things have to get rid of waste products. This process is called excretion. Many animals excrete by urinating and in other ways. Excretion also takes place in plants but is more difficult to observe.
All living things react to the world around them. Reacting to things is called sensitivity. Animals react quickly to things they see, hear, smell or feel. Plants also respond to things around them, but only very slowly and in a more limited way.",A2
"Paul wanted to see Maria. He wanted to talk to her.
'I'll go to the house on the hill,' he thought. 'Perhaps Maria will be there. '
But the house on the hill looked empty. There were no curtains at the windows. There was a big notice on the gate. It said ""For Sale"".
Paul looked over the gate. There was nobody in the garden. Everything was quiet.
'I'll get into the house and look round,' he thought. 'Perhaps I'll find Maria's address. Then I can write to her.'
Paul pushed open the gate, and went up the steps to the house. It was very quiet. He pushed at the front door. It was closed. He walked round the house. There was a window open.
Quickly, Paul climbed through the open window. He was excited and his heart was beating fast. He was in Maria's old home! He remembered her mother. He remembered that terrible evening. But the house was different now. There was no furniture in the room. There were no carpets and pictures. It was empty.
Paul felt a little afraid.
'Is anybody in the house?' he thought. No, he did not hear anything.
Quietly, Paul went to the door of the room and opened it. There was nobody there. He went from room to room. All the rooms were big, and they were all empty.
At last he came to a very big room. He stopped. He knew this room. He had met Maria's mother here! He remembered everything, the old woman, her hard face, the big rings on her hands...And now the old woman was dead.
Suddenly, Paul heard a noise. Somebody was inside the room! The door opened. Somebody was standing in the doorway. It was a woman.

"The people of Nova Scotia were angry. They thought their government had tricked them into joining Confederation. Joseph Howe was a newspaperman and popular politician. He tried to persuade Britain to let Nova Scotia leave Confederation. Britain refused. John A. Macdonald offered more money to Nova Scotia and made Howe a minister in his Cabinet. Howe accepted. Eventually, the people of Nova Scotia began to accept being part of Canada.
In 1869, Canada bought Rupert’s Land from the Hudson’s Bay Company for about 1.5 million dollars. This made Canada six times bigger! The large area was renamed the Northwest Territories. Now, people could move west and begin to settle there. Canada could begin to build railways between the new settlements. 
Canada wanted to make Manitoba part of Confederation. Most of the 12,000 people living there were French Catholic Metis. There were also Aboriginal people and other settlers. Without asking permission, the Canadian government began to divide up the land for new settlers to move in. The Metis became angry and rebelled. Their leader, Louis Riel, was later put on trial and hanged for his part in the rebellions. The Canadian government tried to find a solution. It offered to make Manitoba a bi-lingual province so the language and culture of the Metis people would be protected. The government would also support Catholic schools. The Manitoba Act made the area part of Canada in 1870. The province was much smaller than it is today.",A2

"Therefore, the British government began to get rid of preferential tariffs. The British called wheat “corn”. In 1846, they took away the Corn Laws that gave special rates for wheat to the colonies. This was good for Britain but bad for the colonies. British North America could not compete with cheaper wheat and timber from Europe. Many wheat farmers left their farms and moved to the United States. Timber companies also lost most of their business. This caused an economic bust. Thousands of Irish were arriving on ships but no work was waiting for them. The people of British North America were suffering. They felt Britain had betrayed them. Some began talking about joining the United States. 
Lord Elgin was the Governor General of the Province of Canada. In 1854, he persuaded the United States to sign a free trade agreement or Reciprocity Treaty with the Province of Canada. There would be no taxes on Canadian wheat, timber, coal, fish or potatoes going into the United States for the next ten years. In return, American fishers could fish in the British waters off the Atlantic coast.
After the treaty was signed, the United States became an important trading partner. Exports from the Province of Canada doubled from 1853 to 1855. Britain was getting wheat from Russia. However, in 1854, Britain began a war with Russia. Its supply of wheat was cut off so it began to import wheat from British North America again. This increased trade even more. The economy was booming once again!",A2
"Instead of making it one large province, the Canadian government decided to divide the Northwest Territories. In 1905, it created two provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan. These two provinces also became part of Canada.
Newfoundland and Labrador continued to be a British colony. The colony’s debts became so large that the British had to take over the government. During World War II, Newfoundland was used as an American and Canadian military base for ships crossing the Atlantic. This meant money for the colony. However, after the war, people lost these jobs. Britain did not want to continue ruling the colony. Canada wanted Newfoundland to enter Confederation. It offered to give each family a sum of money. It would also build new roads, ports, and railways. The people of Newfoundland had a special vote called a referendum. Only 52.3% of the people voted to become part of Canada. But, that was enough. Newfoundland became Canada’s tenth and last province. Finally, Canada stretched from sea to sea!
In 1999, the government of Canada created another political region of Canada by dividing the Northwest Territories. The new territory is called Nunavut. The population of Nunavut is eighty five percent Inuit. They control the land and have their own Aboriginal self-government.
In 1982, Canada got a new constitution that replaced the BNA Act. It was called the Constitution Act. It included a Charter of Rights and Freedoms for all Canadians. It recognized Canada as a multicultural country. It said the federal government would give the provinces money for education, health and welfare. However, the province of Quebec did not accept the new constitution. Quebec wanted the new constitution to recognize it as a special province in Confederation.",A2
"For centuries, people have been playing kicking games with a ball. The game of soccer developed from some of these early games. The English probably gave soccer its name and its first set of rules. In European countries, soccer is called football or association football. Some people believe that the name ""soccer"" came from ""assoc.,"" an abbreviation for the word association. Others believe that the name came from the high socks that the players wear.
Organized soccer games began in 1863. In soccer, two teams of eleven players try to kick or head the ball into their opponents’ goal. The goalie, who tries to keep the ball out of the goal, is the only player on the field who is allowed to touch the ball with his or her hands. The other players must use their feet, heads, and bodies to control the ball.
Every four years, soccer teams around the world compete for the World Cup. The World Cup competition started in 1930.
Brazil is the home of many great soccer players, including the most famous player of all, Pelé. With his fast footwork, dazzling speed, and great scoring ability, Pelé played for many years in Brazil and then later in New York. During his 22 years in soccer, he scored 1,281 goals and held every major record for the sport.
People in more than 140 countries around the world play soccer. It is the national sport of most European and Latin American countries. Soccer is definitely the world’s most popular sport!",A2
"The United States was becoming a large and powerful country. It stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The people of the United States believed that one day, all of North America would be part of the United States. This belief was called “Manifest Destiny”. Many people in British North America were afraid they would not be able to defend themselves against such a powerful nation.
In 1865, a Civil War began in the United States between the northern states and the southern states. The North (called the Union) was trying to end slavery in the South (called the Confederacy). Britain was supposed to be neutral in the war. This means it would not help either side. However, certain events caused problems between Britain and the Union government in the northern United States.
The first event was the Trent incident. The South sent two agents to Britain to ask for help in their fight against the North. They traveled on a British ship, the Trent. A Union warship stopped the Trent and found out about the plan. The Union navy took the Southern agents off the Trent. This made the British very angry. The Union had no right to do this in international waters. Britain sent 10,000 soldiers to British North America to prepare for war. The British soldiers found traveling difficult because there was no railway between the Maritime colonies and the Provinces of Canada. Luckily, Union soldiers never came across the border.",A2

Oz gives him a green bottle with the word ""courage"" on it.
""Drink this!"" he says to the Lion.
The Lion drinks it quickly and then smiles. ""Now I feel courageous, very courageous!"" says the Lion, ""Thank you!""
""And what about Toto and me?"" asks Dorothy quietly.
""I can take you to Kansas in my hot-air balloon,"" says Oz, ""Come with me!""
They go into his garden and see the big hot-air balloon with a small box under it.
Oz gets into the box and says, ""Come on, Dorothy! We're going to Kansas!""

"Tony and his mother got on a bus in the middle of the town. At first they drove through streets of small, grey houses. Then the bus left the town and drove along a country road.
The bus stopped in every village. Tony saw green fields and small, quiet villages. Every house had a garden. The smell of the flowers came in through the open windows of the bus.
At last the bus stopped. Tony could see a river and an old bridge. A small road ran across the bridge, through the fields and over a hill. 'Come on, Tony,' said his mother. They got out of the bus and walked two kilometres in the hot sun. There were white and yellow flowers at the side of the road. Tony did not know their names. He wanted to know more about them. He wanted to know more about the trees too. There were no flowers or trees in his street.
He looked at the cows in the fields.
'I've never seen a real cow,' he said to himself. He watched them moving very slowly through the long, green grass. They looked big and quiet.
Tony and his mother arrived at the farmhouse and walked through the farmyard. Chickens were looking for food. A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched them with sleepy eyes.
Mr Wood came to the door and spoke to Tony's mother. 'Hullo, Betty. It's nice to see you again. Thank you for your letter. How are you?' They talked together like old friends.
Tony stood at the door. He felt lost and uncomfortable. But the farmer smiled at him.

"Next week I am on vacation. While I am on vacation, I will work on two projects. First, I will fix the washing machine. The washing machine has been broken for two weeks. To fix it, I will need three tools: a screwdriver, a wrench, and a clamp. It will take one day to fix the washing machine. Next, I will fix our back porch. This is a bigger project. It will probably take about two days to fix the back porch, and will require a screwdriver, a hammer, nails, and a saw. My vacation starts on Monday. I have a lot of work to do, but hopefully I can relax after I finish my work.
Most human beings are awake during the day and sleep all night. Owls live the opposite way. Owls are nocturnal. This means that they sleep all day and stay awake at night. Because owls are nocturnal, this means they must eat at night. But finding food in the dark is difficult. To help them, they have special eyes and ears. Owls have very large eyes. These eyes absorb more light than normal. Since there is little light during the night, it is helpful to be able to absorb more of it. Owls also have very good hearing. Even when owls are in the trees, they can hear small animals moving in the grass below. This helps owls catch their prey even when it is very dark. Like owls, mice are also nocturnal animals. Mice have an excellent sense of smell. This helps them find food in the dark. Being nocturnal helps mice to hide from the many different animals that want to eat them. Most of the birds, snakes, and lizards that like to eat mice sleep at night—except, of course, owls!",A2
"Suddenly he was awake. He could see the light through the curtains. Tina was still sleeping beside him. That was strange. They always woke up together. He looked at his watch. Six thirty. He tried to think. Yes, they always woke up at exactly eight o'clock. He couldn't remember waking up before eight . . . not ever. Why not? Everybody in the city woke up at exactly eight o'clock. Every day.
He got out of bed quietly. Tina didn't move. He walked to the window and opened the curtains. He looked out at the quiet city. Nothing was moving. Then he dressed quickly, and went to the chair and sat down. He had to think. He had to remember. He was still sitting there an hour and a half later when Tina opened her eyes.
'Dan,' she said, 'Dan, what are you doing?'
'I got up early,' he said. Early. It sounded strange. But why did it sound strange?
'Dan, is anything wrong?'
'Wrong? No, nothing's wrong. I just wanted to get up, that's all.'
Tina dressed. She smiled brightly. 'It's time for breakfast,' she said. 'Come on, we mustn't be late.'
'Wh ...?' He was going to say, 'Why not?' But he didn't. He stood up. 'Yes, yes, it's time for breakfast. Look, you go down for breakfast. I'm not hungry today. I'll see you later.'
Tina looked at him. 'We have to go to breakfast. Are you feeling ill? I'll call the doctor.'
The doctor. Yes, he had to go to breakfast. He didn't want to see the doctor. Tina was standing by the door. She looked annoyed.

"The boat for Sifnos left very early in the morning. Because it was April there were not many people on the boat. The deck was very quiet. I sat in one chair and put my feet on another chair. The sea was very blue and it was warm in the sun. I fell asleep.
When I woke up we were passing Serifos. It's the island before Sifnos. Serifos is like Sifnos; the houses are all white and square like pieces of sugar. It's very pretty. As the boat got close to the land I could smell the plants and see the purple of the mountains.
I was very happy. I love the Greek islands, but I didn't know Sifnos. There are so many islands in Greece, you can only know a few of them. I took my guidebook out of my bag and began to read. I knew some of the history of the island already. 'Lots of places to visit,' I thought. I turned the page.
Sifnos was once very rich, the guidebook told me, because of its gold and mines. I knew that. I've seen the Treasury of Sifnos in Delphi. Many, many years ago, the Greeks thought that Delphi was the centre of the world.
'Like Stavros,' I thought. 'He often says that Greece is the centre of the world.'
Many years ago the Greeks built a great temple to the sun god Apollo in Delphi. Every year everyone in Greece had to give something to Apollo's temple in Delphi. They gave Apollo the best fruit and gold from the gold mines.
They always gave Apollo the best. The Treasury was where the people of Sifnos kept the gold which they gave to the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. They built it over two thousand years ago.

"If Wellington thought MPs could be ordered into unity he quickly discovered he was mistaken.
One of the most divisive issues of the day centred on Catholic emancipation. Catholics had been barred from holding public office since the 17th Century but by 1829 these restrictions threatened civil strife. Some Tories, who had championed Wellington's appointment, were aghast at his support for the Roman Catholic Relief Act. One, the Earl of Winchilsea, was particularly vitriolic in his criticism and on 23 March the duke and the earl fought a duel on Battersea Fields. Both survived.
Wellington had been willing to countenance Catholic Emancipation for the greater good, but parliamentary reform he could not stomach.
As a soldier, Wellington had been famed for anticipating what lay ""on the other side of the hill"" but he lacked the same degree of political imagination. Whig party leader Earl Grey led the calls for reform but Wellington would not budge. Out of step with the times, Wellington's popularity plummeted. He lost control of the House of Commons, his government unable to tread a path between the attacks from Ultra Tories and reformists. By November he had little option but to resign.
Kitty was ill. As her health failed, Wellington re-discovered some affection for his wife. He kept vigil at her sickbed in Apsley House, London.
With Wellington at her side, Kitty ran a hand up his sleeve. He was still wearing the amulet she had gifted him decades before. On 24 April, she died. Of little comfort to her in life, Wellington had at least found some common ground with her before her death.",C1
"Magna Carta did not put an end to royal tyranny. Henry III and his successors were capable of ruling just as badly as King John. Kings continued to make war for their own glory rather than for the public good. Taxes continued to mount. Several of the clauses of Magna Carta went unenforced. Judicial visitation of the counties, for example, remained a haphazard affair. Justice continued to favour the rich over the poor. The influential remained more powerful than those without influence at court. Even so, within society at large, the repeated and frequent reissue of the charter encouraged the growth of a belief in essential rights and liberties standing above the authority of any particular king. On occasion, when baronial or local discontent boiled over, as it did in 1258, 1264 and again in 1297, there were calls not only for the reissue of Magna Carta but for root and branch reform of royal government on behalf of the ‘community of the realm’. This ‘community’, first referred to in the security clause of the Runnymede charter, came to play an increasingly significant role in politics, as the King’s need for taxation led to the summoning of ‘parliaments’ (literally ‘speakings together’). Here the barons were expected to approve taxation in return for the hearing of petitions and the redress of their own particular grievances.
Magna Carta did not itself create ‘Parliament’. Nonetheless, by requiring that taxation be imposed only after consultation with the ‘common counsel of the realm’, Magna Carta in many ways pointed the way to the emergence of parliamentary government.",C1
"The church was further bolstered in 1563 when another Act of Uniformity made refusal to take the oath, or the defence of papal authority, a treasonable offence. But this time the foreign threat was real: a revolt in 1569, the papal invasion of Ireland, Elizabeth's excommunication and the arrival of priests from France all underlined the insecurity of the Anglican Church. The severity of the Treason Laws increased alongside anti-Catholic sentiment, effectively killing it as any real force by driving it underground for the rest of her reign.
And it was the length of her reign that secured Anglicanism and established it as Protestant. After the stop-start policies of Edward and Mary, it had 45 years of Elizabethan rule to bed down. Had she succumbed to smallpox in 1562, a religious civil war might easily have followed. But luck struck again, and by her death in 1603 the country was united as had not been possible in the previous century, both by a common religion and a common enemy. Patriotism and Protestantism were two halves of the same coin, a coin baring Henry's title, 'Fidei Defensor'. They still do.
So why is the Reformation important? True, it happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but it established in English minds the image of an island nation, separate and supreme, still resonant today. English policy became increasingly repressive in Ireland, importing Protestant landowners to oppress the locals who resisted conversion. That legacy still lingers, and the abiding sense of anti-Catholicism remained potent enough to be a cause of the Civil War a century later.",C1
"Dorothy who?
The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is little known
For the past four years, I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on, I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. If their eyes light up, and they say things like 'Surely there's one already!' they have passed.
Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel prize ought to be enough. Anyone who held the same distinction in literature would be a household name. But Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was a remarkable individual by any standards, as many-faceted as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects some of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century: among them, the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.
When I began my research, I set out to read some scientific biographies. One of Hodgkin's friends recommended a new biography of Linus Pauling. Pauling was a close friend and contemporary of Hodgkin, worked in the same branch of science and shared a commitment to campaigning against nuclear weapons. I hurried to the main bookshop in the university town where I live, only to discover that not a single biography of Pauling was on the shelves. I now realise I was naive to be surprised that Pauling was not deemed sufficiently interesting to British readers, even though he was the most influential chemist of the 20th century and a winner of Nobel prizes for both chemistry and peace.
Even scientists themselves have doubted the value of the scientific biography. 'The lives of scientists, considered as Lives, almost always make dull reading', wrote the late Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, who laid most of the scientific groundwork that now makes organ transplants possible.
If scientists propagate this negative view, it is hardly surprising if publishers and booksellers share it. Treating scientists differently from everybody else as biographical subjects is one of the outstanding symptoms of the 'two cultures' mentality, the belief that there is an unbridgeable divide of understanding between the arts and sciences, still prevalent in the literary world. Few but the towering giants of science make it into the biography sections of bookshops.
Of course it is nonsense to say scientists, as a group, lead less interesting lives than artists and writers, or actors, or politicians. For some, the fastidiousness involved in maintaining scientific credibility extends to any kind of media appearance. A leading geneticist once told me he was happy to be interviewed about his work, but did not want to be quoted directly or photographed, because he did not want to be perceived as 'self-promoting'.
The avoidance of the personal conveys a false impression of the enterprise of science that discourages young people from joining in, and fosters more public suspicion than it dispels.
Fortunately, gaps are appearing in the smokescreen. Contemporary scientists now regularly appear in the public eye in contexts other than the straightforward scientific interview. For instance, Professor Richard Dawkins presents prizes to winners of a TV quiz, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on television. No doubt these activities have raised eyebrows in laboratories but they have done more to make scientists recognisable as people than any number of academic papers.
The publishing world is also undergoing a transformation. Scientific biographies and autobiographies, if they appeared at all, used to be rather scholarly but dull and over- reverent. The life which the scientist in question led outside work marriage, children, things most people regard as fairly central to their existence - was often dismissed in a couple of paragraphs. That changed with Richard Feynman's Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?, the hilarious and affecting memoir of a man who also happened to be one of the century's greatest theoretical physicists.
More recently, even the greatest names in science, such as Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Marie Curie have been allowed to appear with all their flaws clearly visible. To the reader, it does not matter that Einstein's relationship with his family is 'irrelevant' to his General Theory of Relativity. The question of how creative genius copes with emotional ups and downs, trivial practicalities, the social demands of ordinary life, is absorbing in its own right.
Dorothy Hodgkin was devoted to her scientific work. Her most important successes were solving the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1964, and of insulin, which her group solved in 1969. In each case she pushed the technique into realms of complexity others deemed unreachable at the time.
But she also had three children to whom she was devoted and was married to a frequently absent husband with a career as a historian. Her personal life is not strictly relevant to her work as a scientist, but surely we can all learn from her capacity to unite the disparate threads of her life into a coherent whole. There is much in her life of universal interest, but it would be disloyal of me to imply that this does not include the science itself. Scientific inquiry was the passion of Hodgkin's life, as it has to be for any successful scientist.
How to communicate the nature of this passion is the hardest task for the scientific biographer. Most readers are not equipped with enough fundamental scientific concepts to grasp more complex ideas without a lot of explanation. Understanding scientific ideas is not really any more difficult than reading Shakespeare or learning a foreign language - it just takes application. It is sad to think that educated people, who would be embarrassed if they fail to recognise the name of some distinguished literary or artistic figure, continue to live in happy ignorance of the rich heritage represented by scientists such as Dorothy Hodgkin.

"Hit and miss of mass marketing

AS ALMOST everyone knows, advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite.
Advertising's problems are more fundamental, and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are. That is the principal way in which advertising has gone astray.
Think about your own shopping habits. If you visit a supermarket you may leave with 30, 40 or perhaps 50 items listed on your check-out bill, the average number of items of all kinds purchased per visit of all kinds.
Many of these will not be advertised brands; some others will be multiple purchases of the same brand. At a maximum you will have bought a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands. 
Consumer durables? Perhaps a dozen a year. Cars? If yours is a new car, the statistical likelihood is that it is supplied by your employer.
If it isn’t, you only buy one every three years. And though it may seem otherwise, you do not buy that many clothes either, and most of them will not be advertised brands.
Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. Compare that figure with the 32,500 branded goods and services that, according to Media Register, are advertised. Let’s ignore the 23,000 which spend less than £50,000 a year, and concentrate on the 9,500 brands that Media Register Individually lists and analyses.
Mr and Mrs Average have bought 400 of that 9,500, and not all because of their advertising. That’s about 4 per cent. So you can forget that naive claim usually attributed to Lord Leverhulme: ‘Half of my advertising is wasted but I’ve no way of knowing which half.’ You could say that 96 per cent of all advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96 per cent.
When you’re watching TV tonight, count how many of the commercials are for brands you buy or are likely to buy in the future. For most people the figure seems to be about one in 16 (6 per cent) so the commercials for the other 15 (94 per cent) are, on the face of it, wasted.
You probably think you’re a special case, that you are impervious to advertising. Almost everyone thinks the same. But you aren’t and they aren’t. The truth is nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised.
Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. The notion that every reader of a publication or every viewer of a commercial break might immediately rush out and buy all or even many of the brands advertised is ludicrous. People register only a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest, so waste cannot be avoided. That does not mean advertising isn’t cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.
Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority, because the advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments. Media advertising works, despite its much publicised expense, because it is a cheap means of mass communication.
Nonetheless, all waste is gruesome. With smart targeting the advertiser can minimise the wastage by increasing the percentage of readers or viewers who will respond; but he can never know precisely who will respond. Even the most accurate and finely tuned direct mail-shot never achieves a 100 per cent response. This is one of the fundamental differences between the use of media and face-to-face selling. It is possible, just, to envisage a salesman scoring with every prospective client he speaks to. The same could never happen when media are used. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly.
This is as true of Birth, Marriage and Death notices as it is of soft drink commercials. Any advertiser who can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population) is doing well. Of soap powder, the two top-selling brands in supermarkets would be delighted with a million extra customers. So that any advertising campaign, for any product (or any political party for that matter) which could win over 2 per cent of the population would be outstandingly successful: and that, as I began by saying, is but a tiny minority of the population.
The most cost-effective way to reach them may be the use of mass media, but if advertising is to get going again its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before.",C1
"Beginner Takes All
Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph
The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans, screenwriter, producer and aspiring director. The year began badly when Life and Limb, a film project he had been working on for months, fell through 'almost overnight'. His disappointment mingled with stomach-churning worry: it had been two years since he had earned any money and the promise of that film had been the only buffer between him and an increasingly irate bank manager.
A wise man, finding himself in Evans' position, would have got a job. He could have gone back to being a television executive, or begun a television project that had been on hold. Instead, he made a decision that most people, Evans included, would consider insane. He bought a ticket to America and set off for three months to research his first novel.
Although he was acting very much on impulse, the seeds for the story had been with him for some time, sown by a farrier he met on Dartmoor while staying with a friend. The farrier had told him the story of a docile horse that had turned, no one knew why, into a fiend. Its owners were desperate until they heard of a gypsy who, simply by talking to the animal, transformed its temperament in a matter of hours. Such men, the farrier said, were known as 'horse whisperers'.
Evans' imagination was captured. He began researching the subject with a view to writing a screenplay - he was, after all, a film-maker. But disillusionment with the film world following the demise of Life and Limb prompted him to write the story as a book. And so throughout the spring he drove across the US, stopping at ranches and learning about horses and the men who work with them.
'It was a funny time,' he says now. 'I was observing people, but essentially [ was alone and I really felt as though my life was falling apart. ['d tried for ten years to make a go of it as a film-maker, and here 1was, hugely in debt and wondering how [ was going to feed the children, and thinking maybe it was all just folly.'
He thought that again towards the end of August, by which time he had returned home and written the first half of the book. 'At that point the bank manager was getting really very heavy with us, and I needed to know whether it was worth going on. I plucked up the courage to show it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and said it was ""fine"".'
When pushed, he ventured that Evans might get $30,000 as an advance on the book. 'I had in mind how much 1 needed to payoff a bit of the overdraft and keep us going, and it was more than that. ['d spent seven months on The Horse Whisperer, and there were at least another two to go. $30,000 was a really difficult figure. I was also advised to write a 12-page synopsis of the remainder of the book.'
In October. together with the first two hundred pages of the novel. this was sent to seven UK publishers on the eve of their departure for the annual spending spree at the internationally renowned Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days his agent was on the telephone to report that he had just turned down the first offer of $75,000. 'I said, ""You what?"" And he said, ""It's OK, I just sense something is happening"". '
The events that followed have become publishing history. Within a week - a week of hotly contested auctions - the novel had been sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for 5550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for 53.I5 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel.
'We couldn't believe it; we sat there with our jaws gaping. W e'd never sent the manuscript to New York, we still don't know how it got there,' Evans says. Nor did they send it to Hollywood, but within that same week the major studios were fighting over it. 'My agent in the UK wisely involved an agent over there and when he phoned us to say, ""I think we can get $3 million outright,"" we laughed in disbelief.'
As they all agreed to this sum, it was decided that they should each 'pitch' to Evans. And so, one night in October, he sat in his study while four great film-makers rang, one after the other, to beg for the privilege of paying 53 million for an unfinished novel. Evans told me all this as we sat drinking coffee on a wooden verandah perched above the leafy garden of his home. He said that he had since turned down an offer to write the screenplay of Tile Horse Whisperer.
'It's all been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to spoil it. Writing at that level is a very tough business, and I don't want to become an employee of these people who I like and who have paid me so much money. I'd hate to find myself writing a draft or two and then have them say, ""Thanks Nick, but now we'll bring in so-and-so"". '
He would be involved, he said, but at arm's length. The success of his novel had inevitably brought forth the offer of new backing for Life and Limb, but he was no longer sure that he wanted to make it. ‘I think that I would be foolish not to write another novel,' he said.",C1
"P. D. James

Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer, whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination.

Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her, had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase, as a headmistress of a girls' school. But it is soon apparent from what she says that the authoritative mien is, in fact, a cloak for shyness. She reluctantly admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her novels, ‘is, I suppose, modelled on myself - or rather, the way I would have turned out if I had been a man'. Dalgliesh prefers to unravel the complexities of crimes solo, as does his creator. 'I need time on my own, particularly when I am writing. I can write more or less anywhere as long as I have total privacy.'
She is too modest to concur with the view that she is Britain's best-known crime writer, even though her books - 12 major detective novels - are read avidly by millions all over the world. She herself is a great fan of the works of close friend Ruth Rendell. 'I particularly enjoy her psychological works, written under the name of Barbara Vine.' Books beside her bed are most likely to be by women writers such as Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner and Penelope Lively, although not to the total exclusion of male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers to have been the greatest novelists of their generation.
Success came to P.D. James late in life. Now in her seventies, she was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. Born in Oxford, the eldest of three children, Phyllis grew up mainly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11 years old. ‘I met my husband there - he was a student at the university, and I have always loved the place. That is why I chose it as the setting for An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.'
Reluctantly, she reveals that from a promising start, life has been hard, even tragic at times. Her Irish doctor husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from the Second World War, during which he served with the Royal Army Medical
Corps, a very sick man. 'I had to work long hours to support him and our two young daughters, Clare and Jane. The ideas were teeming in my head, but I could do practically nothing about it - I simply hadn't the time. My husband's parents, however, were marvellous, and took my daughters under their wing, giving them a sense of security throughout those difficult years.'
While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she made good use of her enviable organisational skills. At one point, five psychiatric outpatients' clinics came under her jurisdiction. Then followed 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department, doing administration for forensic science research, and then in the Criminal Law section, in the juvenile crime division. It was while working in forensic science that she became 'quite accustomed’ to the sight of corpses. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. ‘It was, rather, the shape and construction involved in the writing of a crime novel that appealed. I have always enjoyed reading detective stories, and I always knew that I wanted to be a writer.'
‘I didn’t want to use the traumatic events of my own life in a work of fiction. The writing of a detective story appealed as a wonderful apprenticeship for someone setting out to be a serious novelist, and it was suitably remove from my own experience. As I went on, I became increasingly aware that one could stay within the constraints and indeed within the so-called formula of the classic detective story and still write a good, serious and revealing novel about human beings. Writing detective stories', she says, 'is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life - even If that life ls unlovable. Nobody really likes violence.'",C1
"Blacksmiths

THROUGHOUT the ages, iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination, and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers, because they were the sole providers of weapons, armour and farming tools.
They have also been féted as artises. Eighteenth-century smiths produced the wonderfully baroque ironwork for St Paul’s Cathedral. The sinuous metalwork of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was always the work of a talented blacksmith.
But practitioners of these ancient skills had become almost extinct in Britain by the late 1960s, for heavy industry had ceased to have any use for them, and towerblock architects rarely used anything as graceful and pleasing as a wrought-iron handrail.
Over the past 10 years, however, there has been something of a revival - thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Even so, much of the work looks surprisingly clichéd: manufacturers of gates and balconies still advertise their wares as ‘classical’ or ‘Victorian-style’. You cant walk into a trendy design store without being assailed by rusty candlesticks with dangly bits.
Thankfully, alternatives exist and a series of events over the next few weeks aims to promote the blacksmiths craft. The first of these, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the
Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.
Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says: ‘We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because, in a sense, both the general public and blacksmiths have had their blinkers removed.’ Power tools have liberated smiths from all that labouring over a hot anvil, and they can now bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease. ‘In short,’ says Dawson, ‘these artists now have a material which allows them to express themselves.’
About 250 pieces have been produced for the show, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at £90 and climb well into four figures. Most of the money raised will go to individual makers, ‘but a percentage of every sale will be retained by the Association for the promotion of good ironwork,’ says Dawson.
His own contributions consist of an eight-foot gate, and a standard lamp topped with a mouth-blown glass shade.
‘My style results from just allowing steel to bend and flow into shape when its hot. It’s a bit like drawing with metal in space,’ he says.
Many of the artists admit to being fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are relatively malleable when cold, iron and steel are a tougher, more demanding medium. Susan May, a jeweller by training, says, ‘It’s quite magical, because its incredibly soft when its hot, but as soon as it cools down, it becomes really rigid and immovable again.’
Ann Catrin Evans’ mild steel door-knockers and handles seem to have been inspired by those bleak castles that are a stock feature of horror films. One of her designs is shaped like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. ‘I love the fact that steel is cold and hard,’ she says. ‘And the way it feels as though its there forever.’
No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good, to say the least as long as we don’t have to look at any more rusty Candlesticks, that is.",C1
"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING

I thought everyone would be pleased, but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy, why didn’t you stop years ago?’
I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day, life-long smoker, and four hours later I was not, was faintly irritating. I find it curious myself.
The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago.
I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. For one thing, I wholly resented the remorseless pressure from the anti-smoking mob - and I still do. For another, I had low blood pressure and a long-living and healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and threw off colds more easily, it seemed to me, than friends with consciously healthier lifestyles.
On that unexceptional Thursday afternoon, I had simply gone along to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to give up. ‘I shan’t be trying to stop myself, it wouldn’t be fair,’ I announced firmly. ‘Since my motivation for being here is writing, not stopping, it would not be right to expect your method to work on me.’
I could not have been more reasonable. After all, I positively enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me rather knowingly.
We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wished and most of the afternoon was conducted in a room so smoke-filled that we had to open the windows.
I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke I was reluctant to do so — and so were the others.
I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense. Just as smoking itself had become a challenge in the face of opposition, so the notion of stopping began to feel attractive.
The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world?
In many senses, it was easy. The physical craving, the pangs of desire for nicotine, in just the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two and I experienced them over only four or five days.
The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order.
Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing - and it still is.
I am increasingly coming to the view dat for me smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself.
Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each ‘new’ experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes.",C1
"The new emphasis on artillery reflected the mastery of gun founding in England, another development pushed by Henry VIII. It also reflected the need for a naval force to defend the kingdom against European rivals, as Henry adopted his radical new foreign policy, based on religious grounds. The resources for the new cannon, ships and coastal forts came from the seizure and sale of monastic estates. The main impetus behind the rebuild was the fear of French galleys that had defeated the English fleet, led by the Mary Rose, in Brest Roads in 1513. The mobility, heavy bow guns and small target area of the French galleys made them very dangerous opponents.
As rebuilt, the Mary Rose was expected to fight using all her guns, sailing down towards the enemy, firing the ahead weapons, before turning to present one broadside, the stern, the other broadside and then making off to reload, while other ships took her place. This was a lengthy process. The Mary Rose emphasised ahead and stern fire, with close-range stone-shot-firing weapons on the broadside. Two of her best bronze guns were mounted in the stern castle but bore almost directly ahead, just clearing the bow structure. As rebuilt the Mary Rose had a crew of 185 soldiers, 200 seamen and 30 gunners. In addition to cannon they were equipped with 50 handguns, 250 longbows, 300 pole arms, 480 darts to throw from the fighting tops and a wealth of arrows. While the cannon were the main weapons, close-quarters fighting was also expected.",C1
"Despite the collapse of his government, Wellington had continued to lead the charge against Grey's proposals for parliamentary reform.
As his popularity continued to fall, the iron shutters he had installed on his house to protect his windows from the ire of the mob reinforced the image of the 'Iron Duke' refusing to move with the times. But in 1832, with the country in deadlock, Wellington backed down for the sake of the country. After persuading his supporters to stay away from Parliament, the Reform Bill finally passed. Even so, he was mobbed by an angry crowd on Waterloo Day.
Wellington had remained active in government, as foreign secretary and, latterly, a minister without portfolio.
Approaching his ninth decade, Wellington finally retired from public life in 1846. Even then he retained his post as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, unable to step away completely from the public service to which he had devoted his life – servant of crown and country to the last.
On 14 September Wellington succumbed to a stroke at his favourite home, Walmer Castle, in Kent.
In death the duke's divisive political legacy was forgotten. Wellington was the hero of Waterloo once more. On 18 November, Britain said goodbye to a hero of a bygone age. The nation united in a display of grief more extravagant than anything seen before. More than 1.5 million lined the streets to pay their respects as Wellington's coffin was borne to St Paul's, where a further 10,000 dignitaries packed into the cathedral. Wellington may have been gone, but his reputation lived on.",C1
"The end of print may take some time 

Peter Preston 

Transition. It’s a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless, that is, it is newspapers’ ‘transition’ to the online world, an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process – because, frankly, it may not be a process at all. 
But surely (you say) it is bound to happen eventually. Everybody knows that print newspaper sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers’ websites keep on soaring. Just look at the latest print circulation figures. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and many of the rest are down overall between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites go ever higher.  All of which may well be true, depending on timing, demography, geography and more. After all, everyone – from web academics to print analysts – says so. Yet pause for a while and count a few little things that don’t quite fit.
So if sales in that area have fallen so little, perhaps the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, though, the messages are oddly mixed. The latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference.  As for news and current affairs magazines – which you’d expect to find in the eye of the digital storm – they had a 5.4% increase to report. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many showed rapid growth. 
You can discover a similar phenomenon when it comes to books. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up massively this year. The apparent first step of transition couldn’t be clearer.  Yet, when booksellers examined the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn’t one or the other: it was both. 
Tales like these of young people abandoning newspaper-reading are wildly exaggerated. Turn to the latest National Readership Survey figures and you’ll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 following the main national dailies.  And even within Europe, different countries have different stories to tell. There’s Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany the decline has only been 7% all round – with a mere 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). 
Such varying national trends may well reflect a situation far more complicated than the prophets of digital revolution assume. America’s media analysts used to argue that booming online advertising revenues would pay for change and, along with lower production costs, make online newspapers a natural success. But now, with digital advertisements on newspaper sites actually dropping back, such assumptions seem like history.  Already 360 US papers – including most of the biggest and best – have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way of attracting a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package. 
In other words, print is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates raise between nine and ten times more money than online.  Of course this huge difference isn’t good news for newspaper companies, as maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; adrift on the web, the job of just being noticed becomes far harder. ",C1
"Insofar as possible, legislators also attempt to give voice to the policy views of their district and its residents. It is not always easy for legislators to determine the policy views of their constituents; thus, it is far more difficult for them to express constituency views than to help individual constituents with problems they have or fight for projects and state aid for their districts. 
Legislators themselves have little doubt about the quality of the jobs their institutions do with regard to representation. When asked in a recent survey about their legislature’s performance representing constituencies, almost nine of 10 members responding characterized the job as “excellent” or “good” (rather than “only fair” or “poor”). Fewer thought their legislatures did as well making laws or balancing the power of the executive. 
Overall, Americans approve of the job their own representative is doing. Public opinion polls offer evidence of this, as do election results that show incumbents winning 80 percent to 90 percent of the time in both Congress and state legislatures. Yet, people do not feel the same way about representatives other than their own or about the system in general. As surveys conducted by the University of Michigan show, confidence that government officials listen to “people like me” has declined during the past 50 years. A 2009 survey sponsored by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that half the people think that elected officials do not care what plain people think and more than half think that elected officials work to serve their personal interests rather than the public interest. 
Americans are not only represented in legislative chambers by members whom they elect. They also are represented by political parties and interest groups to which they belong or with which they share values, interests or priorities.",C1
"Great sports

Women on a winning streak

To excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to just a haw brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, 27, skier

“It’s a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don’t feel well or it’s windy and you can’t see, but you just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it’s a young sport.”

B. Caroline, 22, cyclist

“Two years ago I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I’d never cycled before! I’m well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I’m not ugly and it worries me that people may think I’ve got where I am because of how I look, not because I’m the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money I do at least four hours' training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming and running.
My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he knows the time you have to put into it — it would be impossible otherwise.”

C. Annabel, 26, rower

“Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don’t start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There’s no continuity so the women’s squad is basically a shambles. But it's great fun and I love being fit, plus there’s a good social life.""

D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker

“At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world — I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different.
The walk across Australia was the worst experience I’ve ever had as far as pain is concerned. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.“

E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer

“Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I’m doing well, they don’t talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages.
When I get to a corner, the men think ‘I’ve got to beat her’, so I’ve had a lot of knocks!
You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It’s very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been classed as eccentrics. It’s great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection always trying to get round with a perfect lap.”

F. Alison, 28, triathlete

“I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I’d really be one, c) racing is very social.
Men and women usually compete together but when an event is given coverage in the press, 90 per cent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 per cent will say, ‘Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women’s event’. The prize money isn’t as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission, so we’re working on it.”",C1
"Our system of government, at both the national and state levels, is based on the principle of representation. People do not themselves govern, nor do they ordinarily vote to adopt laws and public policy. Rather, they govern indirectly by electing legislators who represent them. 
For the framers of the U.S. Constitution, the legitimacy of the government came from the consent of the governed. The House of Representatives, with its members elected by constituencies throughout the nation, was designed to reflect the views of the people. The Senate, with its members originally selected by state legislatures, was designed to reflect the sovereignty of the states. The will of the people would find its way through legislative chambers by means of lawmakers who would assess their constituencies’ preferences and interests and take them into account in deciding matters of public policy.  Legislators would lead, interpret and reflect public opinion as they assembled in Congress.
Today, members of both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate and the houses and senates of the 50 states (except Nebraska, which is unicameral and has a senate, but not a house) are elected by the people and are considered to be representatives of the people.
At the state level, for example, legislators represent their constituents in a number of ways. They help constituents in their district who may have problems with governmental regulation or the service provision, such as welfare benefits, unemployment compensation, driver’s licenses, insurance costs, taxes—almost anything under the sun. They try to secure funds for projects—such as construction of a court house or funding for travel by a high school band—for their districts. They also are constantly looking for as many state dollars as possible to be channeled to their districts as school, county and municipal aid.",C1
"Should the media earn money from content they don’t own? 

Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, it is social media that have revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. 
With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

"At his family's behest, a career in the military beckoned – few other suitable options existed for such an unpromising young aristocrat.
Wellington studied fencing, horsemanship and maths, but remained typically uninterested. His brother’s wealth and influence secured him a number of commissions, first as junior officer in the 73rd Foot and then as aide-de-camp to the lord lieutenant of Ireland. As the French Revolution moved towards its climax, Wellington’s elevation continued, even taking a seat in the Irish parliament. By October 1792 he had held five commissions in six different regiments.
Events in France sent shockwaves through Europe. On 21 January King Louis XVI was executed at the guillotine.
France had declared her egalitarian principles to be universal. The very fabric of established social order was under threat and by February Britain and France were at war. Wellington had to grow up quickly. He marked his new-found focus by setting aside 'frivolous' things like his violin. In April he joined the 33rd Foot, soon becoming the regiment's commanding officer. This was as far as his brother's influence could take him. He would now have to earn his promotions, on active service.
Wellington's opportunity came quickly. In 1794 the 33rd Foot was sent to the Netherlands and he fought the French for the first time.
Though Wellington won plaudits for his role in the fighting, the Flanders Campaign as a whole was disastrous. By spring 1795 British forces had withdrawn, dejected and demoralised, and were evacuated from Hanover. The French had won, replacing the Dutch Republic with a client state. Wellington's first experience of war had come with the taste of defeat. Few of his fellow officers, he saw, had known how to command an army.",C1
"Career Power

Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.

A.
What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires, an agent of change, a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better, as the early theorists believed. It’s not simply about intelligence, either. Pat Dixon, author of the book Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace, says that leadership is about ‘making things happen through people who are as enhuastic and interested as you are’.
Enthusiasm is a key element and, to convey it and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak out articulately and with conviction. ‘It’s having the confidence to say “I believe” instead of “I think”, maintains Dixon.

B.
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says, ‘Most people have a far greater potential for leadership than they realise. The process of becoming a leader is recognising those latent talents, developing them and using them.’
In one sense, we are all born leaders - we just need the right circumstances in which to flourish. While it’s quite easy to recognise leadership in the grand sense — be it in the form of figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Ghandi or even Richard Branson - it may be more difficult to relate it to our own workplace. And yet this quality is now regarded as the cornerstone of effective management.
 

C.
Consider the best and worst boss you've ever had. They may have been equally good at setting objectives, meeting deadlines and budgets. But what about how they achieved them? The best leader will have motivated you and may have given you support. The worst leader would have made you feel like a small cog in the corporate machinery and kept information from you, and then when things went wrong would have reacted as if it were your fault. The first led (very well); the second simply managed (very badly).

D.
Leaders and managers can be seen as different animals. Managers tend to enjoy working according to set boundaries. Leaders create their own horizons. ‘A good manager can keep even an inefficient company running relatively smoothly,’ writes Micheal Shea, the author of Leadership Rules. ‘But a good leader can transform a demoralised organisation - whether it’s a company, a football team or a nation.' 

E.
Whether you’re the boss or a middle manager, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. There are definite lessons to be learnt: 
* Leadership is something we do best when we choose to do it. So find out where your passions and convictions lie. Next time you feel inspired to lead, harness the energy it gives you and act on it.
* Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a powerful part of you. Recognise it.
* Collaboration can be fine, but there will be times when firm leadership is required. Experiment with your style. If you are a natural transactor, try being the negotiator. If you always ask for the views of others, try taking the lead. Watch how the outcome is changed by this change in you.
* You have to set goals, then beat them. Look at the demands of your job and define those where being a leader will greatly enhance your effectiveness and career prospects.

F. 
* Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes. Learn how to delegate and motivate; organise and chastise; praise and raise.
* Don’t assume that your way of leading will immediately win over colleagues. It may even alienate them. Keep working on your communication skills. You don’t have to be liked - but your ideas and accomplishments do.
* Be visible and accessible to those who are important. But bear in mind * You don’t have to lead all the time. Be clear on where your contribution is vital and how you can help others to develop as leaders.",C1
"Sitting down to eat at the Duchess of Richmond's ball, Wellington learnt that Napoleon had advanced within 20 miles of the Belgian capital. ""Napoleon has humbugged me, by God,"" he exclaimed. Early next morning he left for the front. On 18 June, the battle that permanently inked Wellington's name into history got under way. The battle was fierce and bloody but, with his allies, Wellington defeated Napoleon once and for all. Now, at the zenith of his military career, he turned to politics.
Serving under Lord Liverpool, Wellington joined the Cabinet. Politics, he discovered, was every bit as fierce a battleground as those he had left.
Liverpool's government was known for repressive policies. Legislation was passed to keep public order and take action against vagrants, including many discharged from war service after Waterloo. Crowds gathered in St Peter's Fields in Manchester on 19 August to demand parliamentary reform were charged by troops. Hundreds were injured and many killed. The refusal of Wellington and the political classes to countenance social and political reform put them out of step with the public.
Meanwhile, Wellington's first prolonged spell at home since his marriage was doing little to improve his relationship with his wife.
He found his wife irritating and burdensome, rarely bothering to disguise his many affairs. One of his lovers, the well known London courtesan Harriette Wilson, wrote a vivid kiss-and-tell book detailing their exploits together. The publisher, pornographer and scandal-monger Joseph Stockdale, even (unsuccessfully) attempted to blackmail the duke prior to its release. Cartoonists and satirists delighted in Wellington's reputation.",C1
"Hide and Seek

Yvonne Coppard

Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game — surveillance of a suspicious bookshop — when she realises that one of its rare customers is her
Uncle Jim.
He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime, manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends, whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard.
When Emma finds her life in danger, things take a dark and compelling turn - her confinement in the cellar of a derelict house is stunningly handled.
This book reveals the minutiae of family life, the bonds of childhood friendship and warns that adults aren’t always the protectors they ought to be. A vital and convincing read.

Backtrack

Peter Hunt

Two teenagers, ‘peasant’ Jack and Rill, a boarder at a posh girls school, join forces on realising that relatives of both were involved in an apparently inexplicable 1915 train accident, in which eight people died. Varied viewpoints and documents — maps, first-hand accounts, hurt records, railway histories — throw an ever-changing light on the incident, so that the reader works as hard as the two protagonists to understand what happened and why. A clever, complex novel which rewards close attention.

Pigeon Summer

Ann Turnbull

Mary Dyer doesn’t really fit into her family or male-dominated culture; for one thing, she, a girl, loves her father’s racing pigeons and when he must go away to find work, Mary knows enough to carry on managing the loft and winning prizes, despite increasing conflict with her harassed mother. Set believably in 1930, this readable tale has a sound basic message that ‘There are different kinds of cleverness’, which can’t be bad. Thoughtful readers should find satisfaction here.

Yaxley’s Cat

Robert Westall

Unusually, Robert Westall uses the viewpoint of a mature woman for this chilling story of rural prejudice and persecution. Rose, to escape from her materialistic life and her smug husband, rents Sepp Yaxley’s cottage with her two children. A ferocious cat, and bizarre items found in cupboards, reveal the answer to why Yaxley disappeared, but the newcomers’ presence arouses local hostility to the point where their own lives are at risk. By the end, the threatening violence is controlled, but Rose feels just as dismayed by the methodical ruthlessness of her teenage son. Utterly gripping.

Someone’s Mother is Missing

Harry Mazer

At the poor, shambling, noisy end of the family there’s Sam - fat, overtalkative and awed by his supercool and sophisticated cousin,
Lisa, from the apparently rich end of the clan. When Lisa’s privileged world crumbles, it’s Sam who helps her to find some balance, out of which both gain a better sense of reality and the value of family.
The pace is slightly slow in parts but there’s a gentle humour and the developing closeness of the two teenagers is convincingly handled. It could be interesting to both boys and girls, which is a bit of a rarity.

Stanley’s Aquarium

Barry Faville

Barry Faville writes with assurance and humour, vividly evoking his New Zealand setting and creating an intelligent and likeable first-person narrator. Robbie takes a jon gardening for elderly Stanley, finding him at first fascinating and later repellent; when she finds out what he keeps in his aquarium and what he plans to do with them, the book takes ‘thrillerish’ twist without losing its sharp insight into character and relationships. Unusual and compelling.

Dodger

Libby Gleeson

A painful, sad story where the troubled personal relationships plus the stormy school life of Mick are told though a skilful blend of flashback, a teacher’s letters to a friend, the boys own notes and sympathetic narrative. Coming to terms with the negative expectations of others and his own poor sense of self-worth is achieved through a role in a school play and by an impressively sensitive first-year teacher.
Highly recommended, even though it’s truly an agonising read, especially at the end.",C1
"Plugging in the home

Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She recounts here how she was able to transform the family home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last I turned 37 and realised that time was running out if I wanted to resurrect a career in journalism - which I believed had been washed down the plug-hole … the technological plug-hole.
A quick glance at my curriculum vitae showed that I was shamefully stuck in the 1980s, when a piece of carbon wedged in between several sheets of paper in a typewriter was the state of the art. It seemed that only a madman would let me loose on a computer in his newsroom. And why did most of the jobs advertised ask for experience in desktop publishing - which I didn’t have?
I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar in nuclear physics than attempting to lay out a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators were a mystery to me and I still don’t know how to use the timer on the video.
Clearly, there was a gaping hole in what was left of my career and I had to act quickly. Leaving home before the children did would be fraught with obstacles, or so I thought until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a success story you read or hear about that only ever happens to other people, my family and I won a computer package.
Supplied with a laptop computer to free my husband from his desk, and a personal computer for us all, we dived in at the deep end into a strange new world and terms such as cyberspace, Internet and surfing became commonplace in our vocabulary. We took to chatting like old pals via the Internet to strangers around the world. The children forsook the television and I set up a mini-office in a corner of the kitchen with a telephone-answering facility, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem linking me into the information superhighway.
I had everything I would need for working from home - and I could still manage to take the children to school. They were confident with computers from the start, already well versed in them from school. I was much more hesitant, convinced that all my work would disappear without trace if I pressed the wrong button. I could not have been more wrong.
Though far from being adroit, I did manage to learn the basic skills I needed - il was all so logical, easy and idiot-proof. And, like everything that you persevere with, you learn a little more each day.
I recently began freelancing for a magazine, contributing about two articles a month, and I have become smug in the knowledge that I have the best of two worlds.
So how has the computer helped me? Since my schooldays I have always worked at a desk that can only be described as a chaotic mess. 
Consequently, I was always losing scraps of paper containing vital bits of information. The computer has transformed me into an organised worker, particularly when it comes to office administration.
Spreadsheets help keep a record of income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads have saved me a lol of time and effort. For a journalist, getting on-line with the Internet means I can research stories, ask for further information on the bulletin board in the journalism or publishing forums and even discuss the pros and cons of working from home with people from all over the world.
If all this sounds too good to be true, there is a dark side to computing from home. You can be in isolation from physical human contact. There are the distractions of putting urgent jobs about the house first, and when the children are home there are power struggles in our house over whose turn it is to use the computer.
However, there is a growing band of people who have recently bought multi-media PCs, not just for the educational, leisure and entertainment facilities. In my street alone there appears to be a new type of technical cottage industry evolving from the sheer convenience of not having to join the commuter struggle into the city each day. So what characterises home workers as we move into the next century?
A report entitled PC Usage in UK Homes provides the following profile of the millennium computer user: 38 and well educated; 93% own a personal computer and 32% have a CD-ROM device; 38% have a laser printer and 50% a modem.
Taking this into account, I seem to be well ahead of schedule. And who knows, one day I might be e-mailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or, better still, publishing my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or should I say cyberspace is the limit.",C1
"The collapse of the Soviet Union threw the Cuban economy into chaos. But Castro was adamant his Cuba would survive.
Cuba lost around $6bn in annual subsidy from the Soviet Union and could no longer export sugar in exchange for its oil – Cuba’s factories and agriculture were paralysed. Fidel Castro was forced to improvise. He introduced stricter food rationing and opened up the Cuban economy to limited private enterprise, especially in tourism. In 1999, Castro’s ally Hugo Chavez took power in Venezuela and in 2000 Castro signed a deal – sending thousands of doctors in exchange for oil.
Cuban refugees continued to escape Castro’s Cuba. In 1999, Elián González, a five-year-old Cuban boy was rescued from the sea and brought to the US.
The boy was the sole survivor after his mother drowned when their boat capsized. In an intense legal battle Cuban Americans fought to keep Elián in the US, while his father pressed for his return. Castro led the protest marches in Havana. In 2000 Elian returned to Cuba and Castro made him a poster boy of the revolution. Despite his advancing years, Castro kept a grip on power – in 2003 in what would be dubbed the ‘Black Spring’, he imprisoned 75 people in a crackdown on dissidents.
In January, the US sent 20 suspected al-Qaeda members from Afghanistan to the detention camp in Cuba. By November 2002, there were 750 detainees.
In 2003, Castro blasted the US for running what he called a ’concentration camp’ on Cuban soil. The US has maintained a naval base in Guantanamo Bay since 1903 – leasing the area from successive Cuban governments for $4,085 a year. Castro has not cashed the US cheques for the lease since the Cuban Revolution because of America’s ‘illegal occupation’.",C1
"NATURAL TALENTS

In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps.
On this grand evolutionary scale, whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art (whatever changes were needed in the human physique, brain, and sense organs) and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes.
That's a large burden to place on a relative handful of genes. It should come as no surprise, then, that modern studies of animal behaviour have been shrinking the list of attributes once considered uniquely human, so that most differences between us and animals now appear to be only matters of degree.
For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees (which use sticks as eating utensils and weapons), and sea otters (which crack open clams with rocks). As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for ‘leopard', ‘eagle’ and ‘snake’. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals. But if human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, isn’t it strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps?
The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art, in the form of the famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces and musical instruments.
If we're going to insist that our recent creative burst finally does set us apart, then in what ways do we claim that our art differs from the superficially similar works of animals? Three supposed distinctions are often put forward: human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it’s transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Let's scrutinise these claims.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless"". The implicit meaning a biologist sees behind this quip is that human an doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes — the evident functions of most animal behaviours. Of course, much human an is utilitarian in the sense that the artist communicates something to fellow humans, but transmitting one’s thoughts or feelings isn’t the same as passing on one's genes. In contrast, birdsong serves the obvious functions of defending a territory or wooing a mate, and thereby transmitting genes. By this criterion human art does seem different.
The second claim — that only human art not is motivated by aesthetic pleasure — also seems plausible. While we can’t ask robins whether they enjoy the form or beauty of their songs, it’s suspicious that they sing mainly during the breeding season. Hence they're probably not singing just for aesthetic pleasure. Again, by this criterion human art seems unique.
As for human art’s third distinction — that it’s a learned rather than an instinctive activity — each human group does have distinctive art styles that surely are learned. For example, it’s easy to distinguish typical songs being sung today in Tokyo and in Paris. But those stylistic differences aren't wired into the singers genes. The French and Japanese often visit each other’s cities and can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some species of birds inherit the ability to produce the particular song of their species. Each of those birds would sing the right song even if it had never heard the tune. It’s as if a French baby adopted by Japanese parents, flown in infancy to Tokyo and educated there, began to sing the French national anthem spontaneously.
The role of learning in human art is also clear in how quickly our an styles change. Roman authors described geese honking 2,000 years ago, as geese still do today. But humans innovate so rapidly that even a casual museum-goer would recognise almost any twentieth century painting as having been made later than, say, the Mona Lisa. Connoisseurs can do better, of course. When shown a work with which they are not familiar, they can often identify not only when it was painted but who painted it.
Yet even connoisseurs would mistake the identity of two mid-twentieth century artists named Congo and Betsy. If judged only by their works, they would probably be identified as lesser-known abstract expressionists. In fact the painters were chimpanzees. Congo did up to 33 paintings and drawings in one day, apparently for his own satisfaction, and threw a tantrum when his pencil was taken away.
Congo and Betsy were honoured by a two-chimp show of their paintings in 1957 at London’s Institute of Contemporary Art. What’s more, most of the paintings available at that show sold; plenty of human artists can’t make that boast.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction. You might object that human art is still different because most human artists intend their art as a means of communication. The apes, on the other hand, were so indifferent to communicating with other apes that they just discarded their paintings. But that objection doesn’t strike me as fatal, since even some human art that later became famous was created by artists for their private satisfaction.",C1
"'I wish we could have brought the plane,' said Lenina, looking up with dislike at the blank rock face. 'I hate walking. And you feel so small when you're on the ground at the bottom of a hill.'
They walked along for a time in the shadow of the rock, turned a corner and there, in a dry channel worn away by the water in former times, was the way up. They climbed. It was a very steep path that went from side to side of the channel. Sometimes the drums were almost silent, at others they seemed to be beating only just round the corner.
When they were halfway up, a large bird flew past so close to them that they felt the cold wind from his wings on their faces. In a crack in the rock lay a pile of bones. It was all frighteningly strange, and the Indian smelt stronger and stronger. They emerged at last from the channel into the full sunlight. The top of the rock was a flat platform of stone.
'Like the Charing-T Tower,' said Lenina, comforting herself with the memory of something familiar and safe. But she was not allowed to enjoy this comforting comparison for long. The sound of soft footsteps made them turn round. Naked from throat to waist, their dark brown bodies painted with white lines ('like clay tennis courts' Lenina was later to explain), their faces wild, not human, painted red, black and yellow, two Indians came running along the path. Fox fur and pieces of red cloth and birds' feathers were twisted into their black hair. Great brightly coloured headdresses rose above their faces.

CHARLES SPENCER

A. Tamburlaine the Great

Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending, but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands’ staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe’s play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. Antony Sher is in terrific form in the title role, somersaulting from the balcony, sliding down a rope head-first as he delivers a speech, demanding and getting the audience’s complete attention as his eyes glint with a mad lust for power and glory. Great stuff.
Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (01789 295623)

B. Women Laughing

Welcome London transfer for the late Michael Wall’s fine play, seen at the Manchester Royal Exchange in May. The first act creates an atmosphere of unsettling menace as two married couples chat on a sunny suburban lawn. In the second half the location shifts and the piece becomes a powerful, compassionate study of the devastating effects of illness. The British theatre lost a talent of great promise when Wall died at the tragically early age of 44.
Royal Court Theatre, London SW1 (0207 730 1745)

C. Amphibians

Billy Roche is the latest in the long line of Irish dramatists to have enriched the English stage. All his plays to date have been set in his native Wexford, and this latest piece explores the decline of the fishing industry with his usual mixture of rich characterisation, painful emotion and sudden moments of quirky humour. The play sprawls a bit aimlessly at times, but builds to a blistering climax.
Barbican 3 Pit Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

D. Murder by Misadventure

Traditional thriller involving our old friend, ‘the perfect murder’. This time it is Gerald Harper and William Gaunt who play the crime-writing partnership intent on killing each other, and though its all rather familiar stuff; the twists and turns are handled with ingenuity.
Whitehall Theatre, London SW1 (0207 867 1119)

E. The Alchemist

Young director Sam Mendes finds the gold in Jonson’s great comedy of 17th-century confidence tricksters. First seen at the Swan in Stratford last year, the show works just as well on the Barbican’s main stage, with Jonathan Hyde, David Bradley and Joanne Pearce repeating their fine performances as the wicked trio of con-artists.
Barbican Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

Peter James’ production of Harley Granville Barkers rich, panoramic comedy about fashion and the position of women in Edwardian society transfers to London after its success at the Edinburgh Festival. The staging is stylish, the acting excellent, the play itself an unjustly neglected classic.
Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, London W6 (0208 741 2311)

G. Dreams from a summer house

This delightful new musical finds playwright Alan Ayckbourn in unusually benign form as he relocates the Beauty and the Beast story deep in the heart of London suburbia. A lush score by John Pattison and an unashamedly schmaltzy celebration of romantic love combine to make this good-hearted show a real winner. London impresarios looking for a hit should board the next train to Scarborough.
Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough (01 723 370541)

H. The Merry Wives of Windsor

David Thacker’s lacklustre production of Shakespeare’s most farcical comedy came perilously close to being awarded the dreaded thumbs-down symbol, but this disappointing, crudely designed show is redeemed by first-rate comic performances from Ron Cook as the French physician Dr Caius and Anton Lesser as the explosively jealous husband, Ford. Almost everyone else looks faintly embarrassed, as well they might.

"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success
Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession
A
The rules for work are changing, We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yardstick is increasingly used in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be passed over and who will not. The new rules can he used to indicate who is likely to become a star performer and who is more prone to mediocrity. And, no matter what field we work in currently, they measure the trait- that are crucial to our marketability for future jobs, These rules have little to do with what we were told at school was important. The ability to do well in examinations is largely irrelevant to this standard. The new measure takes it for granted that we all have enough intellectual ability and technical knowhow to do our jobs. It focuses instead on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness - the 'people skills' that make up what is now commonly referred to as emotional intelligence.
B
In a time when few guarantees of job security have led to the very concept of a 'job' being rapidly replaced by ‘portable skills', personal qualities begin to play an important role in the workplace. Talked about loosely for decades under a variety of names, from 'character' and 'personality' to 'soft skills', there is, at last, a more precise understanding of these human talents as well as a new name tor them. 'Emotional intelligence' is generally defined as the ability to monitor and regulate one’s own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. In our work-life it comprises basic elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships. There is a common assumption that it simply means ‘being nice', However, at strategic moments it may demand not ‘being nice', but rather, for example, bluntly confronting someone with the uncomfortable truth. Nor does emotional intelligence mean giving free rein to feelings - 'letting it all hang out’. Rather, it means managing feeling so that they are expressed appropriately and effectively, enabling people to work together smoothly towards their common goal.
C
More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a viral component of management philosophy. And the less straightforward the job, the more emotional intelligence matters - if only because a deficiency in these abilities can hinder the use of whatever technical expertise or intellect a person may have. There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, this crucial set of emotional competencies is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world.
D
Whereas one's IQ undergoes few changes, emotional intelligence continues to develop as we go through life and learn from our experiences: our competence in it can keep growing. In fact, studies that have measured people's emotional intelligence through the years show that most people grow more adept at handling their own emotions and impulses, at motivating themselves and at honing their empathy and social adroitness. There is an old-fashioned word for this growth in emotional intelligence: maturity. Not only can emotional intelligence be learnt, but individually we can add these skills to our tool kit for survival. This is especially relevant at a time when it seems a contradiction to put the words ‘job' and 'stability’ together. Emotional intelligence is no magic formula for uncompetitive organisations, no guarantee of more market share or a healthier bottom line. But if the human ingredient is ignored, then nothing else works as well as it might.",C1
"The day I drew Picasso

Richard Cork recalls how, as an 78-year-old student, he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century.

Even seen at a distance, eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour, Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student, filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. Having run out of money, I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront. But I spent much of the time drawing, and was lucky enough to be carrying an ample sketchbook when my encounter with the octogenarian artist took place.
Picasso was known to be a fairly reclusive figure who spent most of his time shut away working high in the hills. So I was doubly astonished to find him seated at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three companions. Without my friend’s prompting, I would never have dared to walk over and ask for his signature. Nor did I imagine, as I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, that he would comply.
But my request was generously granted. Taking the large sheet I passed over, Picasso inscribed his name across the top of the paper. Then, as if unable to resist the blankness below, he added an exuberant linear flourish on the rest of the page. But Pcasso’s art, even at its least representational, was usually anchored in observed reality. So the curves may well refer to a cloud, the wind-rippled sea or the shape assumed by Cannes harbour, dominating his lunchtime vantage point.
Delighted, I thanked him and embarked on a halting conversation. Since Picasso’s English was even poorer than my French, an extravagantly dressed American woman at the table acted as our interpreter. She kept describing him as the Maestro, and it was difficult to combat her gushing interjections. But I did manage to tell Picasso of my voracious interest in art and my admiration for his work.
After a while, I resumed to the boat and proudly displayed the fruit of my visit. But the friend who had encouraged me to introduce myself to Picasso could see that the lunch party was still in progress. ’Is that all?’ he asked, looking at the signature. ‘Why on earth don’t you go back and make the most of it? You won’t get a chance like this again - and he probably wouldn’t mind if you drew his portrait.’
Sketchbook under arm, I returned to Picasso’s table. I thought it wise not to ask him whether he’d mind having his portrait drawn: a refusal at this stage might have wrecked the whole delicate enterprise. So I simply stood by the table, propped my pad against an ironwork screen, got out a stick of crayon and stayed to draw.
Once he noticed, Picasso grinned like an imp and made my task wickedly difficult. He acted out a range of expressions, both ridiculous and macabre - rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue and brandishing his hand in fantastical shapes on either side of his forehead. The entire performance was carried out with the gusto of an instinctive clown.
I was tempted to give up the struggle, but the sheer high spirits of my playful sitter seemed tantamount to a challenge. However obstructive his antics, I felt that he was testing my persistence, in order, perhaps, to discover the true extent of my determination.
As if to bear this out, Picasso at last relented and lapsed into repose. For a few extraordinary minutes, he deliberately gave me the chance to study him without impediment. I noticed how tough and alert he appeared, still taut in a blue-and-white striped jersey. As compact as a wrestler, the deeply tanned figure resembled an athletic 60-year-old rather than a man who would soon be celebrating his 84th birthday.
I marvelled at the youthfulness of his clear, dark eyes, set with startling intensity in features remarkably unencumbered by the folds of slack flesh on so many elderly faces. The eyes were mesmerising, and I tried to give them the necessary forcefulness. After fastening themselves on whatever they wanted to scrutinise, they did not blink until the unwavering gaze moved elsewhere.
He also seemed curiously removed and alone, even though there was plenty of company nearby. His engaging burst of buffoonery could not disguise an underlying gravity of spirit. Content to let his friends do most of the talking, he sat in a very private and absorbed silence, pursuing his own isolated interests undisturbed.
When the American lady told me that the Maestro wanted to see his portrait, I became embarrassed and replied that it wasn’t good enough to show him. Picasso insisted, however, and after I passed my sketchbook over, he gave my efforts a generous nod.
Then, to my astonishment, he announced that it was now his turn. I lost no time in giving him my crayon, and his hand applied a few swift, decisive strokes to the paper. In a matter of seconds, with beguiling assurance, he outlined a bearded face below the head which had taken me so many anxious minutes to produce.
He handed the pad back, and there was a drawing blithely at odds with my dogged strivings. Picasso had moved one eye onto my nose, and summarised my smile in a single, irresistibly vivacious line. I looked like a creature who had strayed from one of his more lighthearted mythological compositions. Perhaps he saw me as an intruder from another world, peering in at him with all the gauche curiosity of a young man amazed to find himself face-to-face with an artist he venerated.
I thanked Picasso, and asked him if he would be kind enough to sign the drawing. After consultation, the American explained that the Maestro says you already have his signature. So there were limits to the generosity he was prepared to bestow on me!
All the same, I look back now and wonder at my good fortune. Meeting Picasso and, more important, receiving his attention meant an enormous amount to me.",C1
"Once a select forum of the great and good, the Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) conference now has millions of avid online fans. How did an elite ideas-sharing gathering go mainstream?
Falling animals, misbehaving toddlers and footage of Justin Bieber may populate the bulk of any YouTube most-viewed list.
But amid the viral clips and pop music promos is a series of videos that seems to go against all received wisdom about what online audiences like to consume.

"And certainly Catherine's education could not be described as appropriate for a heroine. In fact, she had an obvious dislike for the classroom and never could learn or understand anything before she was taught; occasionally she even seemed rather stupid. 
Her mother wanted her to learn music and Catherine was sure that she would like to play the piano, so at eight years old she began lessons. But she soon gave up, and the day on which the music teacher was dismissed was one of the happiest days of her young life. Her drawing ability was also disappointing; although she enjoyed drawing animals, all her pictures, from chickens to horses, looked very similar. 
What a strange, incomprehensible character! Incomprehensible because, in spite of such clear signs of a difficult nature, Catherine was seldom unpleasant; she rarely quarrelled and was very kind to her six younger brothers and sisters and quite friendly with the three older ones. But it still must be admitted that she was untidy, noisy and wild and loved nothing better than rolling down her favourite hill at the back of the house. 
At fifteen, Catherine's appearance began to improve; her skin was brighter, her hair was shinier and nicely styled, her eyes shone and her figure was pleasing. Her love of dirt was replaced by an interest in the latest fashions and in the possibility of going to a ball. She was quite thrilled one day to hear her father remark on her personal improvement: 'Catherine is almost pretty today.' To be almost pretty is a great prize to a girl who has been plain for fifteen years.

'I actually look rather good in jeans. So I rarely wear them. I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.’ So runs the logic of Isabel, 'our heroine’ in this refreshingly zany novel. An art student of 31, devotee of historical romances, she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. Hope, however, springs eternal - which proves to be her salvation, and that of other people in the story. Employing the staccato drama-laden pace of an early silent film, with chapter headings like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired', the author writes with terrific verve.

This is a celebration of the birth and subsequent near-death of a local radio station in America. It is the wry view of a national institution - the wireless - seen through the eyes of a weedy, intelligent child, Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station set up by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to advertise their sandwich bar. Soon the station is beaming out a motley collection of singers, preachers, soap-opera heroes and continuity announcers. This small-town American setting provides the author with huge scope for the dry humour and understated prose for which he is justly praised. He skilfully transports the reader from the present back to the gentler days of the 1940s and 1950s, an era of dime stores, oil-cloth, old-fashioned Ford motor cars and, of course, the wireless.

In the world created by the author, it is quite in order for a second husband to gossip with his wive’s first husband. So, when high-flying professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poetess, he naturally confides in his wive’s ex. The poetess writes rotten poetry, which troubles Richards critical conscience; she’s also trying to get his support for her wrongfully imprisoned brother. However, none of these complications is half as interesting as the way the author untangles them. He moves the plot along with a robust sense of the ridiculous and dissects relationships with perceptive care. It all makes for a highly enjoyable, sophisticated and witty read.

Two sets of best friends - two women, two men - meet in the London of the sixties, and for the next quarter of a century are bound together in life and death. At the outset of this long novel, one of the four, the mysterious American tycoon, James Hudson, is launching a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The launch is crucial, but so is the fact that the woman they both adored (and that one of them married) was killed some years before... Murder, ambition, love and jealousy - it’s all here, and the writing’s good as well. This is one of those books, in size and range, where you can really get to know the characters and be engrossed in them.

Written by one of the very best American fiction writers, this amusing and compassionate story tells how Ian Bedloe, by way of atonement for a sin that leaves him plagued with guilt, becomes 'father' to his brother’s three orphaned children. What with the detritus of domesticity, he is, at 40, slowly sinking into eccentric bachelorhood. The story covers much emotional ground and highlights, in canicular, the touching, tender relationship Ian develops with the youngest child, Daphne. A lovely, warm book with exactly the right balance of pathos and laughter.

Geoffrey Lean
At least it wasn't hard to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, one advantage of longevity is that I have had the chance to meet some of the giants who pioneered thinking in the field. Of these, none stood, indeed, still stands, taller than a small, frail woman, Barbara Ward. I can't think of anyone else more at the heart of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She has synthesised her experience of various environmental movements into her own compelling philosophy. Unwillingly 'volunteered' to cover the field, I found, as a young journalist, that she, more than anyone, made it all make sense.
Picking the book was much harder. It could have been Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But despite its title (which sounded old-fashioned, even in 1976), The Home of Man is, to me, Barbara's most important book. Its focus is on the explosive growth of the world's cities, but its canvas is the great themes to which she devoted her life. It is as eloquent and as impassioned a plea as exists for what we would now call 'sustainable human development'. In the hundreds of books I have read since, I have yet to meet its equal.

When I open the pages of Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the long calls of herring gulls, recall the smell of the guano in the hot sun and visualise the general hullabaloo of the colony. This book explains superbly, through words and pictures, the fascinating world of animal communication.
Read Signals for Survival and then watch any gull colony, and the frenzy of activity changes from apparent chaos to a highly efficient social structure. You can see which birds are partners, where the boundaries are and, later on in the season, whole families can be recognised.
A distinguished behaviourist, Niko Tinbergen came from that rare breed of academics who wish to explain their findings to the layperson. His collaboration in this book with one of this century's most talented wildlife artists, Eric Ennion, was inspirational and has produced a book of interest to anyone with a love of wildlife. His spontaneous style of painting came from years of watching and understanding birds. With just a minimal amount of line and colour, he brings to life how one gull is an aggressor, how another shows appeasement. This is the art of a true field naturalist.

Most definitely, My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that has had the greatest influence on my life. Beyond the obvious reason that it ultimately led me to a wonderful husband, and an exciting career in conservation, this extraordinary book once and for all defined my devotion to the natural world.
I was doing research work into animal vocalisations in Madagascar when I first read the book. I had been there two years and was discouraged by the number of setbacks I was encountering but when, at the end of the day, I opened My Family and Other Animals to where I had left off the night before, the world became a brighter place. Animals, people, joy and beauty inextricably woven together - a microcosm of a world worth saving.
Many people say that our species is the worst because of the terrible things we have done to the others. But I like to think back to Gerald as a boy in My Family and Other Animals, looking at the world's inhabitants as a whole, a family whose members, be they good, bad or indifferent, are nevertheless so intertwined as to be inseparable. And that is a concept we all need to grasp.

A copy of The Shell Bird Book, by James Fisher, found its way into my school library shortly after it was first published in 1966. I was drawn to it at once, especially to the 48 colour plates of birds by Eric Ennion, painted, as the jacket puts it, ... with particular skill and charm'. It was those Ennion images which captured my attention.
I already had copies of other bird books and had spent several holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to begin sketching what I saw as an aid to identification. But in The Shell Bird Book there was so much more to feast on. As well as the glorious Ennion paintings, there were chapters on migrants and migration, a review of the history of birds in Britain, and, best of all, a chapter on birds in music, literature and art.
It was the broad span of ornithological information and the exciting images that steered me towards being more of a generalist in my appreciation of birds and the natural world. The book made it clear that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid and as possible as a rational and scientific one. And, as art was a stronger subject for me than maths or physics, I began to see a door opening for me

"I may be too old for this lark, but here goes!
At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He ponders what has made him — and others of hi sage — take the plunge.
This summer, I quit my job and resolved to rent out my flat and go travelling in South East Asia for a yeaL You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I’m nervous.
It's not as if I haven't done the travelling thing before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned. was determined to do it again some day, But you know how it is ... I fell in love, embarked on a career, bought a Hat and got used to earning a salary. But I gradually realised I had been sacrificing my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in that letter of resignation, it felt as though I'd taken charge of my life again.
I now have no tics. Many of my friends are now married with children and, while they wouldn't swap places with me, they envy me my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no burning career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake!
Why am I so nervous? In the first place, 1t's a question of making the necessary arrangements. How could I bear to have someone else living in my home? And how would I go about organising the letting? And apart from anything else, I had to decide where to go.
T'm a shocking procrastinator. and am already several weeks behind my intended schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not hang around for the start of the football season?' Severing emotional ties makes it even more difficult.
I'm putting it off because, deep down, I wonder if I can still cope with backpacking. Will I be able to readjust to a more basic wav of life? Will I feel out of place among a community of backpackers fresh out of school and university?
Perhaps not. I've discovered it's increasingly common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to disentangle themselves from the lives they've made for themselves and head ofT for foreign climes.
Jennifer Cox, of Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, identifies a growing awareness that adventure is there for the raking: 'The penny's dropped. The sort of people who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity” are realising that they can have it any time they want. They just have to be brave enough and organised enough and confident enough to do it.'
1-'0I' Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have a final fling before settling down. They have bought 'I round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm prepared to sacrifice job security to have the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a niggling thought at the back of your mind that. ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'm going to be in the same position I was in before when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take, When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a ceremonial act of defiance!'
For Matt, who'd just got out of the Army, the year he spent travelling amounted to a period of metamorphosis. ‘When you’re in the military, there's a set wav of doing things, a pattern to the way you approach problems. I went away because I really needed to temper this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, in order to have a reasonable existence as a civilian.'
While there are as many reasons to go travelling at my time of life as there are travellers, there do seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts and so if your contract's just come to an end you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.'
For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specialises in the tales of 'ordinary' travellers, an increasing number of thirty-somethings are taking stock of their lives. 'If you're nor happy doing what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer a question of just seeing it through. Now people are aware that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" any more. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to take a step back and think about your life.'
Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to come to terms with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks nor. 'It's a sign of a better educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paving the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?""
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading off to Central America for a year , does nor believe he's running away. 'It's more a case of running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself' But he does feel some trepidation. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day. saying ""hi"" to everyone and sitting down with a cup of coffee.'
I share Ben's reservations about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges and I'm nor sure I'd be making this journey if [ hadn't found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst. like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.'
It may have taken a helpful kick up the backside to get me moving, but I'm now approaching the next 12 months with a mounting sense of excitement. Whatever the outcome, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having grabbed life by the horns. And in that I'm sure I speak for all of us ageing backpackers.

"Talking shop

Ever entered a store and come away with more than you intended to buy? We reveal the selling devices shops use that are designed to make you spend, spend, spend.

A. The image of freshness 

Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They may place their fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale, to enhance this. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store. The colour of the store's fixtures may heighten the image, too - for example, green may be used because of its association with fresh produce. The bulk of what supermarkets sell -
pre-packaged grocery items such as frozen foods and washing powders - may be quite different from this image.

B. Displaying to advantage

The location of products in the store is considered all-important in determining how well a particular brand sells. Nowhere is this more developed than in supermarkets. With computerised stock-control, supermarkets can find out the parts of the store from which shoppers will select items most often. In these areas can be found products with the highest mark-ups or ones which, though less profitable, sell very quickly. 
Traditionally in retailing, 'eye-level means 'buy-level' — shelves at eye height are eagerly sought by manufacturers, or may be reserved for certain own-brand items. 'Dump bins' containing special offers tempt those who find it hard to resist a bargain.
Increasingly popular is 'complementation' - placing dessert or salad dressings, say, over units containing ice-creams or items that may be eaten with salads such as burgers.

C. Spreading staples around the store

Supermarkets may spread low price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores and a long way from the entrance - shoppers have to pass tempting, higher-profit lines on the way. In similar vein, chainstores may locate the products they have a good reputation for as far away from the store entrance as possible. They can rely on a degree of customer loyalty towards these products, so they gamble that shoppers will go actively looking for them around the store, passing other wares that might tempt them.

D. Less sells more

Chainstores have transformed the presentation of their wares in recent years. Much of the pioneering work has been done by the Next chain, which turned away from the 'pile them high, sell them cheap' approach to popular fashion. Next stores have a 'boutique' appeal - they're noted for displaying limited fashion-wear on the shelves, giving the impression that the merchandise is exclusive. Of course, Next's clothing is not less mass-produced than that of their rivals - the company’s success is as much a testament to good store design as it is to well-designed clothing.

E. Tempting totals

Food shoppers, it seems, are more responsive to the overall size of their weekly or fortnightly bill than to the prices of individual items. Supermarkets take advantage of this by stocking a mix of low mark-up staples and high mark-up items, so it shouldn't be assumed everything that a supermarket sells is cheap. Low prices are of direct appeal to the thrifty shopper.
It’s often said that supermarkets deliberately lose money on certain staples to draw shoppers in - known as 'loss leaders'. More commonly, their low prices are achieved by buying in huge quantities from manufacturers, by offering them a prominent place to display their products or by exceeding sales targets - all of which attract big discounts from the manufacturers.

F. The all-important price-tag

Shoppers tend to buy fewer items in chainstores and may be more aware of individual pricing as a result. So the importance of pricing, say, a blouse at £14.99 as opposed to £15, still holds. (It's also a useful device, apparently, to reduce theft among the shop's own staff, who are obliged to ring up a sale in order to give the penny change.)

G. Lighting to effect

Both supermarkets and chainstores give careful thought to lighting. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible so that shoppers get a fair idea of what the colour of the clothes will be like in daylight. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.

H. Walk this way

Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'. It's not always successful - some shoppers are reluctant to stray off the routes into the sales areas. Marks and Spencer for example, use wood or marble covering for routes, encouraging shoppers to walk on to the more welcoming carpet in sales areas.

I. In-store promotion

As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you - irresistible if you've had nothing to eat before setting out on your shopping trip. In the United States, 'video trolleys’ are being tried out in a number of supermarkets. Each trolley has a screen which advertises products as you shop. Sensors at the end of shelves trigger relevant advertising - so the shopper passing the cook-chill cabinets, say, may receive an ad on the screen for ready-made moussaka. Such trolleys are aimed unashamedly at the impulse shopper, and the makers claim they increase sales by around 30 per cent.",C1
"A trumpet isn’t just for Christmas…

It is strange how many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Out of the blue, Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden, has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today.
His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers of the baroque and classical periods, but new works too. When you meet him, bright-eyed and good-looking, he seems even younger than his years, as fresh and open in his manner as the sound of the trumpet.
Recently in one of London’s premier concert halls he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, something of a party-piece for him, while on television a whole feature was devoted to his work and development, filmed both here and in Sweden.
Born near Malmo, he owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight.
His father, unmusical but liking Louis Armstrong’s playing, had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. Being a serious man, he didn’t pick a toy trumpet, but took advice and bought a genuine grown-up instrument.
The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, whom she persuaded to give her son lessons.
Bo Nilsson was an up-and-coming musician, and at once spotted natural talent. Hardenberger consistently blesses his luck to have got such a teacher right from the start, one who was himself so obsessed with the trumpet and trumpet-playing that he would search out and contact players all over the world, and as a ‘trumpet fanatic’ was ‘always looking for another mouthpiece’.
There the mature Hardenberger has to draw a line between himself and his teacher. ‘The trumpet is so primitive an instrument,’ he explains, ‘that you can’t build a trumpet that is acoustically perfect. Whatever you do, it will have imperfections. Besides, you can’t find two mouthpieces exactly the same. To me it is a matter of getting to know the imperfections and making a relationship with them.’
From the very start Hardenberger seems to have had the gift of finding the right compromise, and making that relationship. Without any sense of boasting, he explains that even in his boyhood years the characteristic Hardenberger sound was already recognisable, ‘the first thing I acquired’.
And unlike the great British contender among virtuoso trumpet-players, John Wallace, who developed originally from a brass-band background and then through working in orchestras, Hardenberger has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple.
From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice André, another player who bypassed the orchestra. The boy bought all his records, and idolised him.
His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career. It was then a question of where, at 15, he should be sent to study. America, Bo Nilsson’s first choice, was thought to be too far away and too dangerous, which meant that he went instead at the age of 16 to study in Paris with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud confirmed his prejudice against going into an orchestra, saying that ‘Playing in the orchestra is like digging in the garden.’
He was objective enough about himself to know that he played the trumpet better than others of his age, but it was only at the end of the first competition he entered, at the age of 17 during his first year in Paris, that he came to realise that in addition he had a particular gift of communicating.
Thibaud suggested that he should enter the competition just for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round only, but he won through to the second. Luckily he already knew most of the pieces in that round too, but on getting through to the final he was faced with a concerto that had already daunted him. He didn’t win first prize that time, but he enjoyed the performance, realising that though he ‘played like a pig’, people did listen to him.
Quoted like that, Hardenberger’s realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. Thoughtfully he refuses to try and analyse what such a gift of communication might consist of, as ‘You risk destroying it in trying to explain. The power of the music lies in the fact that it can always move people.’",C1
"POWER DRESSING

EVERY SUMMER, the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world, where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? How do they get away with it? The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues of the Open University are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try, a century after Darwin’s death, to settle the matter.
Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. That is, in a crowded and hence competitive world, the individuals best suited to the circumstances - the ‘fittest' - are the most likely to survive and have offspring.
But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert. The peacocks tail, by contrast, was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance, and Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection’. The driving mechanism was simply that females liked — in his words - 'beauty for beauty’s sake’.
But Darwin’s friend and collaborator, Alfred Russel Wallace, though in many ways more 'romantic' than Darwin, was in others even more Darwinian. 'Beauty for beauty's sake’ he wanted nothing of. If peahens chose cocks with the showiest trains, he felt, then it must be that they knew what they were about. The cocks must have some other quality, which was not necessarily obvious to the human observer, but which the hens themselves could appreciate. According to Wallace, then, the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.
Now, 100 years later, the wrangle is still unresolved, for the natural behaviour of peafowl is much harder to study than might be imagined. But 200
birds at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds yet are used to human beings, offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues at
Whipsnade have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
In practice, the mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.
But whether the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down. William Hamilton of Oxford University has put forward the hypothesis that showy male birds in general, of whatever species, are the most parasite-free, and that their plumage advertises their disease-free state. There is evidence that this is so in other birds. But Dr Petrie and her colleagues have not been able to assess the internal parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks to test this hypothesis. This year, however, she is comparing the offspring of cocks that have in the past proved attractive to hens with the offspring of cocks that hens find unattractive. Do the children of the attractive cocks grow faster? Are they more healthy? If so, then the females' choice will be seen to be utilitarian after all, just as Wallace predicted. 
There is a final twist to this continuing story. The great mathematician and biologist R A Fisher in the thirties proposed what has become known as ‘Fisher's Runaway'. Just suppose, for example, that for whatever reason - perhaps for a sound 'Wallacian’ reason a female first picks a male with a slightly better tail than the rest. The sons of that mating will inherit their father’s tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This is how the runaway begins. Within each generation, the males with the longest tails will get most mates and leave most offspring, and the females predilection for long tails will increase commensurately. Modern computer models show that such a feedback mechanism would alone be enough to produce a peacocks tail. Oddly, too, this would vindicate Darwin’s apparently fanciful notion - once the process gets going, the females would indeed be selecting 'beauty for beauty’s sake’.",C1
"The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action.

One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. ‘Hasn’t even acknowledged us,' Sue Brown says out of the corner of her mouth. ‘Very poor.’ It is a classic arrival-phase error, and one that Sue has encountered scores of times in her 11 years as an inspector. ‘But this isn't an ordinary three-star place,' she protests. ’It has three red stars, and I would expect better.’
To be the possessor of red stars means that the Globe is rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide published by the organisation she works for. However, even before our frosty welcome, a chill has entered the air. Access from the car park has been via an unmanned door, operated by an impersonal buzzer, followed by a long, twisting, deserted corridor leading to the hotel entrance. ‘Again, not what I had expected,’ says Sue.
Could things get worse? They could. ‘We seem to have no record of your booking,’ announces the receptionist, in her best sing-song how-may-I-help-you voice.
It turns out that a dozen of the hotel's 15 rooms are unoccupied that night. One is on the top floor. It is not to the inspector's taste: stuffiness is one criticism, the other is a gaping panel at the back of the wardrobe, behind which is a large hole in the wall.
When she began her inspecting career, she named an early reputation for toughness. ‘The Woman in Black, I was known as,' she recalls, ‘which was funny, because I never used to wear black. And I’ve never been too tough.’ Not that you would know it the next morning when, after paying her bill, she suddenly reveals her identity to the Globe’s general manager, Robin Greaves.
From the look on his face, her arrival has caused terror.
Even before she says anything else, he expresses abject apologies for the unpleasant smell in the main lounge. ‘We think there’s a blocks drain there,' he sighs. ‘The whole floor will probably have to come up.` Sue gently suggests that as well as sorting out the plumbing, he might also prevail upon his staff not to usher guests into the room so readily. ‘Best, perhaps, to steer them to the other lounge.’ she says. Greaves nods with glum enthusiasm and gamely takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months, and you can see him struggling to believe Sue when she says that this dissection of the hotel can only be for the good of the place in the long run.
Not that it’s all on the negative side. Singled out for commendation are Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who dished out a sheaf of notes about the building’s 400-year history. Dinner, too, has done enough to maintain the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, thereby encouraging Greaves to push his luck a bit. ‘So what do we have to do to get three rosettes?' he enquires. Sue's suggestions include: ‘Not serve a pudding that collapses.' The brief flicker of light in Greaves' eyes goes out.
It is Sue Brown’s unenviable job to voice the complaints the rest of us more cowardly consumers do not have the courage to articulate. ‘Sometimes one can be treading on very delicate ground. I remember, in one case, a woman rang to complain I’d got her son the sack. All I could say was the truth, which was that he'd served me apple pie with his fingers.' Comeback letters involve spurious allegations of everything, from a superior attitude to demanding bribes. ‘You come to expect it after a while, but it hurts every time,’ she says.
Sue is required not just to relate her findings to the hotelier verbally, but also to send them a full written report. They are, after all, paying for the privilege of her putting them straight. (There is an annual fee for inclusion in the guide.) Nevertheless, being singled out for red-star treatment makes it more than worthwhile. So it is reassuring for Greaves to hear that Sue is not going to recommend that the Globe be stripped of its red stars. That is the good news. The bad is that another inspector will be back in the course of the next two months to make sure that everything has been put right. ‘Good,’ smiles Greaves unconvincingly. ‘We'll look forward to that.’",C1
"But he most regretted his denials that the industry aimed its advertising at teenagers. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands. So what did the companies do? They increased the advertising.""
""Did you know how much money the tobacco companies were making from cigarette sales to children?"" Rohr asked. ""About two hundred million dollars a year. The tobacco companies know that 3,000 kids start smoking every day and that nearly all adult smokers start as teenagers. So they have to target young kids. They know that one-third of the 3,000 kids who start smoking today will die from their addiction.""
The jury was fascinated by Robilio. Rohr took a few steps forward. Then he asked, ""How did you answer the arguments that nicotine is addictive?""
""I helped the tobacco companies think of the answer. It goes something like this: 'Smokers choose the habit. So it's a matter of choice. Cigarettes aren't addictive, but, even if they are, no one forces anyone to smoke.' I used to make this argument sound good. The trouble is, it's not true.""
""Why isn't it true?""
""Because the issue is addiction and an addict can't make choices. And kids become addicted quicker than adults."" Hoppy came to the trial that Monday morning, for the first time. Millie was thrilled to see him. His sudden interest in the trial was strange, however; he'd talked about nothing else for four hours the night before.

"Duffy, the gardener's boy, had seen Rosanna half an hour before, running towards the sea. 'Come with me, Duffy,' said Cuff. 'And you, Mr Betteredge, stay here till I come back.' They hurried off
towards the Shivering Sand, but not long afterwards Duffy came running back. I had to send one of Rosanna's shoes quickly. 
I sent him back to say I would follow with the shoe. Fifteen minutes later, I reached the shore. Dark clouds were rushing low overhead. The sea was thundering at the mouth of the bay, sending great waves rolling in over the sand. Cuff was alone on the beach. Hearing me approach behind him, he
turned. There was a look of horror in his eyes. He grabbed the shoe out of my hand and placed it in a footmark in the sand. It fitted exactly.
We followed the footprints to the mouth of the bay. They went into the water at a place where the rocks and the sand joined. Seconds earlier the rising tide had wiped them out. We looked everywhere for footsteps coming back towards land until the rising water forced us to stop. 
Cuff stared out over the waters rushing in deeper and deeper over the whole face of the quicksand. There was a look of defeat on his face. 'A fatal accident has happened to her on those rocks,' he said. I could no longer feel the driving rain, all I could hear was her telling me that the sands seemed to be pulling her to a watery grave.

"Margaret and her liquid assets
Margaret Wilkins is said to have a ‘sixth sense’. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up.
Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business, using technology such as drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But when it comes to locating water, she needs nothing more than a forked hazel stick. The couple's success rate is higher than 90 per cent. Dowsing - the ability to locate water, minerals and lost objects underground - is a so-called 'sixth sense'. There are many theories about how it is done, ranging from the physical, such as magnetism, to the spiritual. One of the most credible is based on the knowledge that everything on this planet vibrates, water more than other matter. It is suggested that dowsers have an acute ability to sense vibrations while standing on the Earth's surface; some dowsers say that they can 'sense' water, others that they can smell it, smell being the most acute sense.
For the Wilkins, the drought years of recent times have been busy, with an almost six-week-long waiting list at one stage. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with wells that have dried up: 'We will see customers only once in a lifetime because wells last for a long time.' Other customers own remote cottages or barns, now holiday homes, where the expense of running water pipes for great distances is prohibitive. Others are golf-course developers with clubhouse facilities to build.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 metres down. 'You can't drill a well where there is the slightest risk of farm or other waste getting into the water supply. The water we locate is running in fissures of impervious rock and, as long as we bring the water straight up, it should give a good clean supply, though Cornwall is rich in minerals so you have to watch out for iron.'
Another necessity is electricity to drive the pump; this is too expensive to run across miles of fields so ideally the well should be near to existing power supplies.
After considering all this, Margaret can start to look for water. On large areas, such as golf courses, she begins with a map of the area and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and gently move it over the map. It will swing when it is suspended over an area where there is water.'
After the map has indicated likely areas, Margaret walks over the fields with a hazel stick, forked and equal in length and width each side. 'Once I'm above water I get a peculiar feeling; I reel slightly. When it subsides I use the stick to locate the exact spot where we should drill.' Gripping the two forks of the stick with both hands, she eases them outwards slightly to give tension. 'When water is immediately below, the straight part of the stick rises up. It's vital to drill exactly where the stick says. A fraction the wrong way, and you can miss the waterline altogether. My husband will dowse the same area as me; usually, not always, we agree on the precise place to drill. If we disagree, we won't drill and will keep looking until we do agree.'
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation, carrying out some curious old tradition down in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment' and that is the closest we can get to understanding why she locates water so accurately. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?

"The journey from our town to the capital was a journey of about five hours. When I arrived at Mr Jaggers's office the clerk told me that he was in court, and that he had left word I should wait in
his room. He led me to a dark room. After I had waited for a long time Mr Jaggers arrived.
Many people, men and women, who had been waiting for him outside the office, made a rush at him. He addressed himself to two of the men.
'Now, I have nothing to say to you,' said Mr Jaggers, pointing his finger at them. 'I want to know no more than I know. As to the result, it could go either way. I told you that from the start. Have you paid Wemmick?'
'Yes, sir,' said both the men together.
'Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!' said Mr Jaggers, waving his hand at them to put them behind him. 'If you say a word to me, I'll throw up the case.'
'We thought, Mr Jaggers -' one of the men began, pulling off his hat.
'That's what I told you not to do,' said Mr Jaggers. 'You thought! I think for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to find you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't hear a word.' 
The two men looked at one another as Mr Jaggers waved them behind him, and fell back and were heard no more.

"BOOK A

Steve Martin’s Compelling Evidence is compelling indeed. The narrator, a lawyer struggling to build a new practice after being forced to leave a high-
powered law firm, finds himself manoeuvred into defending his boss’s wife when she is tried for her husbands murder. The trial scenes are riveting, with the outcome in doubt right up to the verdict, and a really unexpected twist in the final pages. This is a terrific debut into a crowded genre.

BOOK B

Curtains for the Cardinal begins with a bang, and plunges the charismatic Sigismondo, troubleshooter for the aristocracy of the Italian Renaissance, into a turmoil of politics, clerical intrigue and high-wodety murder from which we are always confident he will emerge unscathed to disclose the guilty parties. The plot is convoluted and the book is about 50 pages overweight, but it is still great stuff.

BOOK C

File Under: Deceased introduces a refreshingly different new detective from a first novelist, Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector, ideally positioned, it seems, for a bit of investigating when a strange man falls dead at her feet. Undaunted by attacks from various quarters - perhaps tax inspectors are used to this sort of thing - and the disapproval of her handsome local detective sergeant, gutsy, versatile Leah is a winner in every way.

BOOK D

Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker sets that most literate of private investigators, Spenser, the job of assisting his friend Hawk to clear drug dealers out of a deprived estate in rundown Boston. The slick dialogue comes almost as fast as the bullets, but there are few corpses and more philosophy than usual. High-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

BOOK E

False Prophet by Faye Kellermann, features her usual pair of detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, investigating an attack and burglary at the house of a legendary film star’s daughter. The author’s easy writing style and eye for odd human behaviour make this an entertaining mystery.

BOOK F

Husband and wife, Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, write as a team. Blood Red, Snow White features another lawyer, another female client, but the action is all outside the courtroom and the defender finds himself becoming the victim as the plot unravels. All the classic ingredients of romance, money and violence are mixed efficiently to produce an engrossing suspense novel.

BOOK G

Dead for a Ducat by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher in a new role, that of intended victim. The hilarious collection of characters are brought together to film the story of Robin Hood, but Philip isn’t the only person to feel this is not the way his career should be developing. Simon Shaw never fails to entertain, but in moving his star actor from black comedy to farce, he gives a performance below his usual high standard.

BOOK H

Fall Down Easy is Lawrence Gough’s best book for some time. Canadian police hunt a versatile bank robber who preys on female bank tellers. The slow, expertly-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the clever, disturbed robber raise this way above the average detective novel.",C1
"Chewing gum culture

It’s fashionable, classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today’s gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners which help to hold the flavour and improve the texture.
This was not always the case, though. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree, a shrub found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Grecian women, especially, favoured mastic gum to clean their teeth and sweeten their breath.
American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees when the bark was cut. Lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States in the early 1800s making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree of the Central American rainforest.
Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew, and soon a whole industry was born based on this product.
Yet repeated attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed. As the chewing gum market has grown, synthetic alternatives have had to be developed.
Today the few remaining chicle gatherers, chicleros, eke out a meagre and dangerous living, trekking for miles to tap scattered sapodilla in near-100% humidity. Conditions are appalling: highly poisonous snakes lurk ready to pounce and insects abound.
Most alarming is the unpleasant little chicle fly that likes to lodge its eggs in the tappers ears and nose.
Braving these hazards, barefooted and with only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero will shin a mature tree in minutes to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow down to a bag below.
Each chiclero must carry the liquid on his back to a forest camp, where it is boiled until sticky and made into bricks. Life at the camp is no picnic either, with a monotonous and often deficient maize-based diet washed down by a local alcohol distilled from sugar cane.
Yet, punishing though this working environment is, the remaining chicleros fear for their livelihood.
Not so long ago, the United States alone imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America. Last year just 200 tonnes were tapped in the whole of Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.
Meanwhile, the world's gum producers are finding ingenious ways of marketing their products. In addition to all the claims made for gum - it helps you relax, peps you up and eases tension (soldiers during both world wars were regularly supplied with gum) - gums greatest claim is that it reduces tooth decay.
Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes this. Our saliva, which neutralises the acid and supplies minerals such as calcium, phosphate and fluoride, is the body’s natural defence. Gum manufacturers say 20 minutes of chewing can increase your salivary flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavours. Glycerine and other vegetable oil products are now used to blend the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial - but some flavours still need natural assistance.
In addition, one hundred and thirty-seven square kilometres of America is devoted entirely to producing the mint that is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world.",C1
"Is your office working ok?

Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices, to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist, who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. Here are their verdicts.

Office A. Advertising Agency

Building Health Consultant: This office is about as simple as it could possibly be; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows opening straight onto the street. It is difficult to see why this space works but the occupants who are part of a small, dynamic team, appear to have few complaints. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators — pretty much, perhaps, as they do in their own homes. This may be the key: a team of seven people have crated a happy, homely working environment and do not have to put up with any externally imposed bureaucracy.
Ergonomist: The furniture here has evolved; no two pieces match. Much of it actually creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren’t adjustable and many are broken. Although in that way this environment is poor, the personnel have a varied work schedule, which they control — office work, out meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom and muscular problems.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are delighted with the variety of work and the versatility of the office space. They said their office was ‘just the right size’ — small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to be able to be on your own and focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, simultaneously conveying images of efficiency and creativity.

Office B. News Service

Building Health Consultant: While the office may not be very exciting, it appears comfortable and is not disliked by the staff. The air quality and general maintenance standards appear to be good. This is helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: I was not surprised to learn that the company had already employed the services of an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space provision is good, although the layout could be improved. But the environments is impersonal and unstimulating, with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare apart from year planners and a poster describing maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years and relationships are satisfactory. The office could be improved if the desks were positioned to make the sharing of information easier. Proof of success or information on forthcoming projects could be displayed on the walls.

Office C. Bank

Building Health Consultant: An office that produces mixed reactions from those working in it. The feeling inside is akin to being in a glass case, viewed by, and viewing, countless similar exhibits. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a relatively small space, the air did not appear to be stale. Even standing only 1.5 metres away from a smoker, it was not possible to smell his cigarette. 
Ergonomist: The office area is, sadly, very standard and totally uninspiring. The desks are adequate, but only just. Not all the chairs being used for computer operation conform to requirements but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desk units with lowered keyboard shelves; this is no longer considered appropriate for modern equipment.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are mutually supportive and well served by technology. Numerous communications awards are on display. The wood coloured panelling and brown carpet give a slightly sombre effect. The office is a buzz of activity.

Office D. Newspaper

Building Health Consultant: It is difficult to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning control is very crude, resulting in large variations in temperature. The space is cluttered and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is very dusty — there are plenty of places for dust to lodge. The shed-type roof also collects dust, which, if disturbed, showers those sitting below.
Ergonomist: The furniture would be more at home in a carpentry workshop than in a high-tech industry. Most of the chairs are of little value to keyboard users, particularly those who are shorter than about 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack suitable adjustment and have armrests that prevent the user from getting sufficiently close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, soiled carpets, dust and dirt everywhere. A lot of scope for improvement — the place needs a good tidy-up, individual success could be more recognised, air conditioning needs to be improved immediately — there are so many smokers. Few conversations were going on when we visited; everybody seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt a policy of team-working.",C1
"A history of the apple

Apples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size. But the late twentieth century is in danger of squandering its heritage.

Prehistoric wilding 8,000 BC

Human beings have been munching apples since prehistoric times. They spat out apple-pips in neolithic Britain. And 10,000 years ago they left apple remains to carbonise around their Swiss and Italian lakeside homes. In Switzerland and in the regions adjoining the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even appear to have dry-stored apple-halves for winter. But these were wild crab apples, tiny wizened fruit which, in Ancient Britain came to be known as ‘windings’. They had little in common with the apples we know today.

Norman knowledge 1000 AD

From the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended.

Mediaeval favourites 1200

Several kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word ‘costermonger’ - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street. But prosperity declined as the country was hit by successive droughts, the Black Death and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced and more were imported. This went on until the sixteenth century when Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with a ‘great store of grafts’ including the famous Pippins, from which he grew the first ever modern-style orchard at Teynham in Kent.

Settler treasure 1750

By the seventeenth century apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who sailed to Canada, Australia, die US, South Africa and New Zealand took apples and apple-pips with them, counting these among their most treasured possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Settlement, took them to South Africa and the Pilgrim Fathers who boarded the Mayflower carried them to America. In North America the most famous apple-planter was john Chapman, or ‘Johnny Appleseed’. Born in 1774, he planted seedling nurseries from Pennsylvania in the east through Ohio into Indiana in the west. The Indians regarded him as a medicine man and his apple-tree enthusiasm, odd clothing and religious devotion - he distributed religious tracts tom in pans for widespread circulation - stayed many folktales. He was said, for example, to be so kind to Gods creatures that he even slept with bears.

Modem Delicious 1850 

About this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer called Jesse Hiatt discovered something sprouting from the roots of a dead tree. The shoot grew into an apple tree bearing a totally new apple which Hiatt named ‘Hawkey’. He sent it to a fruit show and on biting into one the judge exclaimed ‘Delicious, delicious!’. In 1895 the apple was introduced to the trade as a ‘Delicious’ and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

Granny Smith 1850

Another of the most famous modern apples was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of transported convicts, Maria was fiercely independent, rejecting both the criminal life of her parents and the bureaucratic hypocrisy of the colonial administration. She worked as a midwife in the small township of Eastwood in New South Wales, where she was known as ‘Granny-Smith’ because she took on responsibility for maintaining the farm and orchard, which was the family’s main source of income. One day in 1868 she found a small tree pushing its way through a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and before long was harvesting the world’s first major crop of green apples, soon to be famous all over the world. When asked how the tree came about she said, ‘Well, it’s just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish’ - a comment which referred not only to the fruit but also her own convict origins.

Uniformity ales 1950

Apples are now grown all over the world from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to small luxury orchards throughout Africa. Most, though, are grown commercially and come from just half a dozen varieties - usually chosen for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. While amateur gardeners in the UK have kept many old apple varieties alive, the US has lost forever most of the apples it had 100 years ago.
But consumers are starting to demand more variety. We can’t leave the responsibility of saving diversity in our apples - or any other food - up to the random selections of amateur gardeners. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all.",C1
"Photographing People

People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

A. GROUPING PEOPLE

Avoid straight lines in group shots. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels. Otherwise, have some of the group sitting or kneeling at the front so that you can see all the faces, or raise your own viewpoint.

B. POSING FOR PICTURES

People seldom act naturally in front of the camera. Often they stiffen up and the pose becomes rather wooden. Relax your subject by helping him to find a comfortable position. You might suggest he folds his hands or puts them in his pockets.

C. THE RIGHT APPROACH

Never try to pretend that you are not taking a picture of someone when it is clear that you are as this only creates tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to have their picture taken - perhaps after some initial protestations - and are quite flattered by it. But they are likely to become rather self-conscious and you may need to direct them. A picture can be spoiled by the fact that the subject is looking rather aimlessly out of the picture so that the interest lies elsewhere.

D. EYE CONTACT

A picture gains immediate impact if the subject appears to be looking at the viewer of the picture. Ask your subject to look into the lens - not necessarily to smile as well — and this is the effect you will get. The subject may not be able to do this for too long: he may become self-conscious or be distracted by someone nearby. So remind him once more, just before you release the shutter. Or try saying something funny or unexpected as you take the shot for a genuine reaction rather than a meaningless stare.

E. CANDID CONCENTRATION

An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to concentrate on something within the picture area. Your subject might find this easier to do, and the viewer can follow the attention to another part of the picture. You get the impression that you are observing the subject unnoticed. Candid shots have a special fascination and the subject’s expression is vital to the picture.

F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES

Expressions and the gestures that go with them tell us more about the subject of a photograph than anything else. Even if he is obviously badly treated and hungry, a laughing child provokes a smile from the viewer, whereas a sad expression produces a sympathetic sadness in the viewer, however apparently comfortable the subject may be. Look for familiar expressions for your portraits: shrugs, winks, anger, tears, thumbs-up, fist-clenching and so on. They are an instant visual language.

G. SITUATION INTEREST

Though shots which isolate a figure or face prominently have great impact, the subject's background or environment can add extra interest and information about the subject. When using a background in this way, try to exclude details that are not relevant to the subject or blur them by focusing selectively. Make sure that the subject is not overwhelmed by the background - a wide-angle lens will make your subject appear relatively larger by comparison with the background.

H. INTERACTION

Wherever two or more people are talking, arguing, haggling, joking or working together, there are opportunities for good pictures. Couples make appealing shots; so do mothers and babies, teachers and children or teams of people working or playing a sport. Look out especially for contact between the subjects - either eye-contact or physical contact, like a protective hand on the arm or a handshake. Or show how one is reacting to another by waiting for an animated expression or telling gesture.

I. PEOPLE AND PLACES

Many pictures of people are taken on holiday or during an outing - partly to show the place they were visiting. A little care will greatly improve this type of picture. To show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building (or mountain, or lake) in the frame. Ask your subjects to come fairly close to the camera and compose the picture so that the group forms a foreground interest without obscuring the background. If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be far easier to do. A good picture will show a balance between the subjects and the place they were visiting, so that both claim an equal share of the viewer's attention.

J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?

In answer to this question, first decide why you want to take the picture. If you are taking a picture to remember someone by someone you may have met briefly on holiday, for example - then you will want a good clear picture and it would be worth asking the subject to pose against a well-chosen background. Pictures of the family, on the other hand, can be very tedious if they are a succession of formal poses in front of places of interest. Candid pictures of events as they happen are far more lively, and you are more likely to get unselfconscious shots when you know the subject well. A picture taken on the spur of the moment will jog the family memory in future years far better than a posed portrait.",C1
"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst

The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support

If you applied for a job in some countries, you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting, as much as anything else, that would determine your suitability for the job.
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting analysis is increasingly being used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions.
She says: ‘Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.’
According to Ms Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: ‘Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.

The person behind the handwriting: examples analysed by graphologist Patricia Marne. ‘I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.’

‘Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.'
Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. ‘You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred.’
A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.
Ms Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form ‘threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting - how far the writer has deviated from copybook script - indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.
Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the ‘i’ are a bid for attention, and crossing the ’t’ heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronising attitude.
Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately, and this has to be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels that more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing.
This will happen soon, she believes. ‘It’s actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.’
Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance.",C1
"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West?

Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture’s role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Some GPs, midwives and physios use it regularly for pain relief.

A. What's it all about? 

Traditional Chinese medicine sees health as a state in which the energy of the mind, body and spirit are in harmony. According to the theory, energy or Qi (pronounced chee) flows around the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each linked to an internal organ, and lots of tiny meridians take Qi to every cell. When the flow of Oi is upset, blocked or weakened, the body is said to be out of balance: weakness or illness may result. During a consultation with a traditional acupuncturist, he or she will try to find where imbalances occur in the Qi. This is done by feeling pulses on your wrist, examining your tongue and assessing your general appearance. He or she will ask about your medical history, current health, general well-being, state of mind, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin. He or she may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians, to stimulate the flow of Qi.

B. Over three hundred points
 
The points used for acupuncture are related to meridians so won’t necessarily be near the site of the complaint. People often say they feel a not unpleasant dull ache or tingling sensation when the needle is gently manipulated. This is either done by hand or by attaching the needle to an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this sensation shows the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian.
There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

C. Science tells us how

Without accepting the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, doctors here have accepted that acupuncture can work for pain relief. This is because they have been able to provide scientific explanations of how it might work. For example: 
* It has been suggested that stimulating particular nerves blocks pain signals and stops them from reaching the brain.
* Some scientists believe that stimulating acupuncture points releases natural pain-relieving substances (endorphins).

D. What type of pain can be treated?

Many people with chronic long-term pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. Back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine and post-operative pain are commonly treated with acupuncture.
Other types of pain which acupuncturists claim to treat include menstrual pain, facial nerve pain and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

E. Modern use for an ancient treatment

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, one development has been rather more recent. The use of acupuncture instead of anaesthesia during surgery only started in the 1950s. It was this that helped to convince some doctors outside China that there was more to acupuncture than mind over matter.
In China today, acupuncture is used during all sorts of operations, from tonsillectomies to caesareans, and is even used in open heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation or with drugs. It's claimed that the pain is more or less eliminated, but it varies from person to person. It's hard to imagine many of us finding the option of lying awake on the operating table very attractive. But acupuncturists say that acupuncture anaesthesia involves none of the side-effects of conventional anaesthetics (e.g. nausea), and you recover from it more quickly.

F. Always effective

As with most complementary therapies, clinical trials to evaluate acupuncture are difficult to run. But trials that have been done have shown that 50 to 80 per cent of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally quote a similar success rate. They accept that it won’t work for everyone and that people vary in their responsiveness.
Traditional acupuncturists say that for chronic long-term pain it will usually take between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief. But some improvement should be felt after just two or three visits.

G. A different approach to pain

But Western and Chinese medicine view pain rather differently. Like most alternative therapists, an acupuncturist views his or her patient in a holistic way. This means not just focusing on specific symptoms. An acupuncturist spends a long time making a diagnosis, trying to find underlying weaknesses in the Oi. He or she will also want to know what external factors are causing the pain. For instance, is the pain worse in the cold, heat, damp or wind? Does it feel sharp, dull, throbbing, constant or burning? These are seen as important factors in deciding how acupuncture can be used to treat the pain. It's unlikely that your average medical doctor would take such things into account, isn't it?

H. Traditional or not?

Some medical professionals do have traditional acupuncture training. Others - including many GPs who practise acupuncture reject traditional Chinese theory and subscribe to scientific explanations.
But many traditional acupuncturists believe that only by applying traditional Chinese medicine is it possible to bring about deep changes that lead to a longer cure - something that is very difficult to assess in trials.
Care should always be taken in choosing an acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for funner investigation if necessary.",C1
"Under Sarah's Spell
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt
There cannot he many artists who l10 not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist, is one. She is not remotely interested in the concept
of the artist as creator, let alone that of the artist as genius: 'It's not the artist
who is important, but the work,' she states. Janson is so self-deprecating that she would almost like you to believe that her trompe-l'oeil works paint themselves.
All of which does not bode well for a magazine interview. 'I just don't like to shout about myself,' she says, and then covers her face in horror when asked if she minds being photographed for the feature, Cut to her sitting room 30 minutes later (a wonderful space in a Hock of artists' studios in London, filled with paintings and drawings) and you find two women bent double with hysteria. Her confidence gained, the interview becomes a fascinating, amusing (and sometimes hilarious) encounter.
Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, after two years' solid drawing at art school ('the best training any artist can ever have'}, a degree in graphic illustration and a stint at a publishing house. But illustration never really satisfied her, and she joined a specialist decorator, Jim Smart ('one of the best in his day'). Smart asked her to do one trompe-l’oeil, and that was it. 'Suddenly my interest got channelled,' she says, She left to set up on her own, 'not really knowing where I was going, hut feeling that I was on the road to somewhere.' Her instinct was right.
Janson’s observational skills and fascination with detail (gained through illustrating) proved essential qualities for a trompe-l'oeil artist. 'People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation.' She insists (in that self-deprecating way) that she is still learning. 'The moment you think that you've mastered a field you might as well give up.’ She is also brutally honest about her 'failings' ('I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete') and is frank about her mathematical abilities. Faced with a huge commission for the domed chapel ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she became totally confused when calculating measurements. ‘I thought to myself, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you
think you are?”’ This habit of self-questioning and a reluctance to openly acknowledge her skills has spawned an oddly distanced attitude to her talent. Janson often speaks in the third person: ‘When I finished that ceiling, I thought, “Well I didn’t do it, she did”.’
Of course, her trompe-l'oeil schemes can speak for themselves. Janson's work is in a league of its own, far above those who have jumped on the bandwagon (the art of trompe-l'oeil has experienced something of a revival, hut not with entirely satisfactory results) and she has a string of major corporate and private commissions behind her. Much of her work is inspired by architecture or made for architectural settings. There is the trompe-l'oeil dining room for one client, based on the facade of a Venetian palazzo, and the painting at the end of a corridor in a Hat, which gives the illusion that you can step into two further rooms.
There is always a danger with trompe-l'oeil, though, that once you get the joke, your attention is lost, something of which Janson is acutely aware. 'Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and then engage your imagination. That is the most important part.'
While trompe-l'oeil has to be clever, it must also, Janson believes, be personal to the client. 'I love the interaction with clients; hat is where the ideas arc horn,' she says. 'Without the rapport, the job of creating a trompe-l'oeil scheme becomes rather difficult. Some clients have firm ideas about what they want; others do not. You have to he willing to listen. You have to get inside a client's imagination.' Many have become friends, nut least because Janson practically lives with them if she works on site.
Janson is generous in praise of her clients. 'I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls.' she confesses. And, they too, seem delighted with her, which is why she is constantly busy - despite her inclination to play down her talent. 'I really don't like to shout about myself,' she repeats at the end. 'Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout.' True, perhaps, hut you could never really become bored with Janson or her work. It certainly deserves to become better known, and I am prepared to incur her wrath while I blow her trumpet.

"Life was getting out of hand

Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and rediscovers the joys of manual labour.

Everyone is in love with technology. It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK.
These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment.
However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor -
a £48 call-out fee, a labour charge of £15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.
This makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us.
So when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost.
I am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go.
Of course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were becoming too apt to collapse in front of the television, or slot in a video, I sent back the rented colour equipment and we returned to the small black-and-white portable.
It is a real strain on the eyes and concentrates the mind on what is really worth watching. We now spend a lot more time walking the dog (who never liked television anyway), reading, talking or pursuing other hobbies.
One of these, in my own case, is sewing; and here is another gadget that went by the board. My old Singer sewing machine is now an ornamental plant table, and as l cannot afford to replace it, I have taken to sewing by hand.
We have come to believe that we could not do without it, and if we do resist the notion that our lives would be unmanageable without the appliances of science we certainly do not want to relinquish them. Pity the generations whose lives were blighted by tedious and blister inducing toil. Even our brains are relieved of exertion by computers that not only perform miraculous calculations with amazing speed but now provide entertainment.
In fact, the time I now spend placidly stitching is anything but tedious, and the advantages are numerous. For a start, I can sew and listen to the radio - another rediscovered pleasure - or I can talk with family and friends. If it is a simple task, I can watch the programmes I do want to see on television, and alleviate my puritanical guilt at sitting in front of the box by doing something useful at the same time. And what a lovely, cosy feeling it is to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea for company.
Quite wrongly, I had tended to think with horror of the women who sewed elaborate garments, robes, linen and household items by hand. I thought of those long hours, the strain on the eyes and so on. 
There is a wonderfully soothing quality about executing a craft by hand, a great satisfaction in watching one's work become neater, more assured. I find things get done surprisingly quickly, and the pace of life suddenly slows down to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also freed from one of the most detestable aspects of late 20th century life the need to rush to finish an activity so that I can rush to the next.
Meanwhile I have regained control of my sink, where I plunge my hands into the suds and daydream while doing the washing up agreeable, if temporarily forgotten, activity.
The result of all this brooding is that I now prowl the house with a speculative eye. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave oven, that powered lawnmower? Come to think of it, we could save an awful lot of money by doing without electric lights!",C1
"Science flying in the face of gravity

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories.

It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft.
But appearances were deceptive and the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel.
There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places with the air of condemned men.
For 12 months, they had competed with other students from across the continent to participate in the flight. The challenge, offered by the European Space Agency, had been to suggest imaginative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions.
Those with the best ideas won a place on this unusual flight, which is best described as the most extraordinary roller-coaster ride yet devised. For the next two hours the Boeing's flight would resemble that of an enormous bird which had lost its reason, shooting upwards towards the heavens before hurtling towards Earth.
The intention was to achieve a kind of state of grace at the top of each curve. As the pilot cuts the engines at 3,000 metres, the aircraft throws itself still higher by virtue of its own momentum before gravity takes over and it plummets earthwards again.
In the few silent seconds between ascending and falling, the aircraft and everything inside it become weightless, and the 13 students would, in theory, feel themselves closer to the moon than the Earth. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor.
Then the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. For 20 seconds we conducted a ghostly dance in the unreal silence:the floor had become a vast trampoline, and one footstep was enough to launch us headlong towards the ceiling.
We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else.
After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.
Our first curve completed, there were those who turned green at the thought of the 29 to follow. Thirty curves added up to ten minutes 'space time’ for experiments and the Dutch students were soon studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, hoping to discover how it is that cats always land on their feet.
At the appropriate moment the device they had built to investigate this was released, floating belly-up, and one of the students succeeded in turning it belly-down with radio-controlled movements. The next curve was nearly its last, however, when another student landed on top of it during a less well managed return to gravitational pull.
Next to the slightly stunned acrobatic robocat, a German team from the University of Aachen investigated how the quality of joins in metal is affected by the absence of gravity, with an eye to the construction of tomorrow's space stations.
Another team of students, from Utah State University, examined the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened in ultra-violet sunlight. Their flight was spent attempting to produce the films under microgravity. They believe that once the process is perfected, satellites could be equipped with solar sails that use the sun's radiation just as a yacht's sails use the wind. 
After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning’s breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.
This was a feeling that would stay with us for a long time. ‘It was an unforgettable experience,’ said one of the students. 'I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more.’",C1
"The camera never lies 

Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, when he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting, he thought he was seeing scientific proof that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. 
But it can, and always could. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered. ",C1
"Are you too nice for your own good? 
When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant, I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. 'I'm so sorry', I beamed, when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens. 'There must have been a misunderstanding. I'll sort it out straight away,' I smiled, having served chicken Kiev to a strict vegetarian. 
It came naturally. Smiling was a necessary part of the job, dealing with customers - but when I look back at the experience now, I can see that what I was actually doing was desperately covering up for my own inadequacies, my incompetence. 
I had no idea what I was really supposed to be doing, so I'd smile nicely and hope I would get through the day alive. And it quickly became a habit that stuck. In fact, it's a habit that has stayed with me for nearly twenty years. 
Recently, I interviewed a group of top businesswomen about what they felt was the key factor in their success. Was it their acute business acumen, their nerves of steel in the boardroom, their ability to spot an opportunity when it arose? 
I was completely caught off guard, and quite taken aback when one woman, Miriam, a highly successful manager of a top football club, explained to me how she had survived and prospered in a particularly male-dominated environment. 'You have to learn to stop smiling,' she said. 'You don't need to make people like you all the time. You just have to do your job, and do it well. And the job isn't just about being nice.' 
It's so simple, but I had never really stopped to notice.

"He had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter, and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness. Finally, she cried, 'Now, not another word, please! I am going!'
'How kind you are!' he said, kissing her on the forehead.
The next morning she was off to Rouen in the coach, to consult Monsieur Leon. She stayed for three days. They were three wonderful days. They stayed down near the harbour at the Hotel de Boulogne, and there they lived, with the curtains closed, the doors locked, the floor covered with flowers, and iced drinks brought up every morning. Towards evening they would take a boat and go and have dinner on one of the islands. As they left the town, smoke rose up among the trees, and the red sun, reflected on the oily water of the harbour, looked like blood on polished metal. 
They went down between the rows of boats, and the noises of the town grew fainter and fainter. When, finally, they arrived at their favourite restaurant, she untied her hat and they stepped out of the boat on to their island. They went into a small cafe, with dark fishing-nets hung up at the door, and sat themselves down in the low-ceilinged room. They ate small fried fish, followed by cherries and cream, and then went and sat on the grass.

"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world, comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is housed in a purpose-built gallery with excellent natural light. The advantages of plaster casts are many: groups of sculptures originally set up together but now split between various museums all over Europe can be viewed together as originally intended. Nearly all the most celebrated works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in one afternoon.

B. Cambridge Darkroom

Cambridge Darkroom is a centre for photography with community darkrooms and a gallery showing a varied exhibition of photography and related media. We regularly run courses and workshops for people of all ages and abilities, including our popular Beginner’s Course, a shorter Induction Course and Master Classes with invited photographers. We have a membership scheme whereby all our members can use our darkrooms. We also encourage young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to develop their skills with our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We stock photographic books and an magazines and carry a full range of photographic materials.

C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology

The Sedgwick Museum houses a magnificent collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks and minerals of all geological ages, and from all parts of the world. It also houses Britain’s oldest intact geological collection, that of Dr John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original early 18th century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was Professor of Geology and keeper of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his long life, he added enormously to the collections, laying the foundations of a truly outstanding museum. The collection is arranged by geological age so that the major changes in life on Earth can be traced through time.
The new Whewell Gallery houses the beautiful minerals and gems of the collection. The displays are accompanied by full explanatory labels to explain both their nature and modern use.

D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs

There are over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs in the collection, taken by members of the university’s staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and undertakes photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are of considerable general interest as a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the effects of human activity from prehistoric times to the present day. There is a small display in the entrance hall and the knowledgeable library staff will be happy to deal with canicular enquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed but copies can normally be purchased. These are made to order and ordinarily take about a month.

E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre

Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre, the second oldest and longest surviving centre in the world, is one of the regions most unusual tourist attractions. Hours of enjoyment are to be had creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates off tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By formulating resin copies, known as facsimiles, the centre has made it possible to preserve the originals and still make brass rubbing an accessible pastime to all. The brass plates, as an alternative means of memorial to the tomb statue, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Through various revolutions most of the beautiful brasses were destroyed. The vast majority of remaining brasses are to be found in Britain and the widest range of examples can be seen at the Cambridge Centre.",C1
"Solar Survivor

Charles Clover ventures inside Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home.

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second, appropriately enough, is Britain’s greenest dwelling, the ‘autonomous house’, designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, together with that of their three teenage children and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. You could easily miss the traditional-looking house, roofed with clay pantiles, on a verdant corner plot 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to echo the burnt-orange brick of the town’s nineteenth-century buildings and won approval from the planners even though it is in a conservation area.
Ring the solar-powered doorbell and there is total silence. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off (at Robert’s insistence), there is a monastic stillness. It is a sunny summer’s day, the windows are closed and the conservatory is doing its normal job of warming the air before it ventilates the house. Vale apologises and moves through the house, opening ingenious ventilation shafts and windows. You need to create draughts because draught-proofing is everywhere: even Edison and Faraday have their own air-locked miniature door. 
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They began by designing a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. Then they got carried away and decided to do without mains water as well. They designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water, which they pass through two filters before use. Water from washing runs into the garden (the Vales don’t have a dishwasher because they believe it is morally unacceptable to use strong detergents). Most details have a similar statement in mind. 
‘We wanted people to see that it was possible to design a house which would be far less detrimental to the environment, without having to live in the dark,’ says Robert. ‘It would not be medieval.’ The house’s only medieval aspect is aesthetic: the hall, which includes the hearth and the staircase, rises the full height of the building.
The Vales pay no water bills. And last winter the house used only nine units of electricity a day costing about 70p — which is roughly what other four bedroomed houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less, when £20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and generating equipment arrive and are erected in the garden. The house will draw electricity from the mains supply for cooking and running the appliances, but will generate a surplus of electricity. There will even be enough, one day, to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales claim not to use except in the very coldest winter.
So is it warm in winter? One night in February when I happened to call on him, Robert was sitting reading. It was too warm to light the fire, he said. The room temperature on the first floor was 18C, less than the generally expected temperature of living areas, but entirely comfortable, he claimed, because there are no draughts, no radiant heat loss, since everything you touch is at the same temperature. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady in the early years of the twentieth century was entirely comfortable at 12.5C, he says, because of the insulation provided by her clothing. Those people who live in pre-1900 housing, he suggests, should simply go back to living as people did then. Somehow, it is difficult to think of this idea catching on. 
The house’s secret is that it is low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder’s merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build — it cost the same price per square metre as low-cost housing for rent. Not surprisingly, the commercial building companies are determinedly resisting this idea.",C1
"The long-distance runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyans’ high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. This gorgeous, if lonely and isolated, spot is Nanyuk: for the past three years it has been my base for mid-winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands.
But not once on those trips had I trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil. On my fourth and most recent winter training trip to Kenya, however, I broke a personal tradition. I both competed in my first-ever race in Kenya’s oxygen-thin air and stayed at Kenya’s national team training camp, which is where the country’s top runners prepare for their annual assault on the World Cross-Country Team Championships.
I was invited by Kenya's national team coach when I finished fifth - behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan - in the World Championship 1O,000 meters race. It was an opponunity not to be missed. Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity.
These benefits have been borne out by the successes of generations of Kenyan runners.
My first African race - which came before my spell at the Kenyan team training camp - was also a first for the whole continent. Held in Nairobi, it was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil.
If nothing else, it was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but 3 were Kenyan. And I honestly felt I hadn't had a bad race!
However, I don’t believe Kenyan success can entirely be put down to the altitude factor. Kenyan runners are also noted for their refreshingly uncomplicated approach to the sport. While their running style is seemingly effortless, their diet simple and their manner of conversation relaxed, they also seem to love competing.
But the least discussed aspect of the puzzle of Kenyan success was perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp soon provided the answers.
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.
It's a fairly basic affair, though: there are few comforts. The athletes live among the college's regular students and are housed six to a room in cinder-block dormitories.
The athletes' days at the camp are dominated by three work-outs: a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, followed by a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily regime began at six. We crawled from our bunks and assembled to be briefed by the coaches for the morning run.
“Run easy, you have a hard job today”, we were warned as we left by the coach who'd invited me.
The total distance covered each day was about 40 kilometres - a little short of a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, with just the one scheduled run of 20 kilometres, which certainly came as a welcome respite from the rest of the week’s three daily work-outs.
Running apart, life was complication-free. A splash of water on the face and a brush of the teeth sufficed for pre-breakfast preparations. Breakfast itself consisted of tea, bread and boiled eggs, taken in a sparsely-lit, small dining area.
Lunch and dinner both had a similar menu: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach and tea. When the day's running was over, in the early evening, we would pile into a car and drive down to bathe properly in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya’s shrinking glaciers.
By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. That success just can’t be attributed to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone.
I couldn't stop myself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps these are the secrets, perhaps these are the real reasons behind Kenya’s rise to the top of world distance running.",C1
"Ordinary people, ordinary lives

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like, the sort of people they were in their youth? The glimpses rare diaries give us are frustratingly incomplete, family anecdotes only half remembered. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional.
Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people’s autobiographies, producing a hardback book of at least 20,000 words — with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.
The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. 
“When I started I didn’t take it nearly so seriously as I do now, having met people who genuinely will talk and have led interesting lives,” she says. “They would say they are doing it for their children or for posterity, but they are getting quite a lot out of it themselves. They enjoy doing it.""
The assurance of confidentiality encourages her subjects to overcome any instinct of self-censorship. 
“I had the confidence to be honest,” says a 62-year-old man who made and lost one fortune before making another. “I was surprised at what came out. There were things that hurt, like my divorce, and the pain was still there.”
“I did it for my family, so that perhaps they could learn something, but I have not yet let my children - who are in their thirties - read it. They were hurt by things in my life and there are a lot of details which I don’t feel I want them to know at the moment. If they insist, I’ll let them. But I think I’d rather they read it after I was dead.”
He also recognised patterns laid down in childhood, which showed themselves in repeatedly making the same mistakes. It is something Ms Renier has detected in other people. “It’s amazing how many people really have been conditioned by their parents,"" she says. “The injunctions and encouragements that were laid down in childhood have effects for the rest of their lives. They become caught in repeating patterns of behaviour. They marry the sort of people of whom their parents approved — or go in the opposite direction as a sort of rebellion.”
“A lot of disappointments come out. Sixty years later they still are regretting or resenting things that were never resolved with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had hang-ups in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They live their lives in an attempt to impress a parent who wasn’t impressed and if that fails some of them seem to be seeking permission to say ‘I can’t stand my mother’.”
Recorder rather than inquisitor, Ms Renier keeps her distance. “It’s not for public consumption and I’m not there as a very nosy person. People have got carried away and told me something, then said, ‘I’m not sure if that ought to go in’. I put it in anyway - they can remove things when they see the draft. But generally people want to be honest, warts and all.”
“It’s not vanity publishing, it’s not people saying ‘Gosh, I’ve had such an interesting life the world’s got to know about it.’ Things are moving much faster than at any time in history and we are losing sight of what happened in the past. It’s a way of giving roots. We need some sort of link to our ancestors because people don’t sit around in an extended family any more. People want a little immortality.”
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: choose your own colour of library buckram, pick your own title.
Fascinating to the private audience at which each book is aimed, the results are obviously not of the dirt-at-any-cost school of life story. Ms Renier organises her material logically and writes well, the final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost - inevitable with the time involved — clearly deters many people.
“I thought it would be a more downmarket product than it is,” she says. “But the people I’ve done have all been county types, readers of Harpers & Queen, which is one of the magazines where I advertise. They’re the sort of people who at one time would have had their portraits painted to leave to their descendants.”",C1
"Take Five Careers

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who discuss their different professions: the highlights, the drawbacks and their typical working day.

A. THE BRAIN SURGEON

Name: Anne

Age: 34

ANNE'S DAY

""I get up at 6.30am, go the gym at 7am, get to work by 8am and start operating at 8.30am. I operate all Monday and Wednesday, as well as some Friday afternoons. Most standard head operations take three hours, but some operations take all day. I’ve worked ten hours straight through on occasion without eating or going to the loo.
Deciding when to operate, and what to do, can be stressful. I don’t feel particularly stressed when operating, but sometimes I worry about what I’m going to do the next day. Brain surgery tends to be a last resort for a patient, but when it works it’s tremendous, and more than makes up for the unsuccessful times. From 10am to 1pm I hold an out-patients’ clinic, when I explain the operations. I enjoy this and find it quite easy to talk to the patients. If they get upset, I comfort them, but time pressure can make this difficult.
I leave work between 6pm and 8pm. Some nights and weekends I’m on call, and I always carry my bleeper. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about the people I've left behind, and at night I dream I’m operating. I’m hopeless at switching off.""

B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER

Name: Marita

Age: 31

MARITA'S DAY

""I get up at Z45am, leave the house by 8.20am, take the train to work and arrive at 9.15am. At 10.30am on Monday we meet to discuss what were doing, any problems or whether anyone needs help. We work in teams - in my team there are three senior designers, a company partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. The work usually involves ten to fifteen per cent design: the rest is production. I’ll be given a brief by the client - with luck the company will have clear ideas about what they want to say, their target market and the form of the project. I then spend three or four weeks designing, researching and developing the project.
After this I present my ideas to the client and once they’ve agreed to them, we work out estimates and budgets, and I start commissioning photographers and illustrators. I liaise with the printers and make sure the needs of the job are being met, and on time. I spend a lot of time managing people. I have to be able to communicate with a broad range of people, and briefing them correctly is essential. When their work comes in, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Keeping several jobs going at once can send stress levels sky-high. Deadlines are always looming, and no day has a set structure.
Lunch is at 1pm for an hour, when we try to get out to the pub. Otherwise I have sandwiches and work through. It’s a great feeling if the client gives a good response to the designs you’ve done and you know the project has worked; it’s a great disappointment when you’ve worked really hard and the job gets rejected. I get home at 7.30pm at the earliest; often it’s 8.30pm and sometimes much later. I find it hard to unwind when I get back, especially if I’m very busy.”

C. THE CHAUFFEUR

Name: Linda

Age: 42

LINDA'S DAY

""I get up at about 7am most days, but two or three mornings a week I meet a long-haul flight from Heathrow or Gatwick and get up between 4.30am and 5am. At 10.30 or 11am I might go for a bike ride, or swim. Because chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I have to watch my diet and exercise quite carefully. I usually have a big breakfast, though, and just have snacks during the day. People often ask me to recommend restaurants, nightclubs or shops, so I have to know my way around. Luckily, a lot of the jobs are pre-booked, so I get a chance to look routes up beforehand. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are anti-social, some arrogant, some downright rude. But most of the time people are very well behaved and I’ve built up a good rapport with my regular clients.
There are times when I hear a conversation in the car and have to make sure my eyes are firmly on the road and my ears shut. Sometimes the press have tried to make me talk about clients I’ve carried, but I won't. I work a seven-day week, up to fifteen hours a day. I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to get to bed by 11pm.""

D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER

Name: Tracy

Age: 27

TRACY'S DAY

“I get up at about 7am, leave the house at 7.30am and get to my first job. My assistant and I spend most of our time maintaining gardens we originally designed and landscaped. We do a few commercial jobs but most of our work is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At about 11am we get hungry and go to a local cafe for a big breakfast. I often look at my watch and wish it was earlier and that time didn’t pass so quickly. In summer I may work until 10pm; in winter until 4.30pm.
The business office is at home, so when I get back I listen to any messages and respond to any calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I’ll usually arrange a consultation with them in the evening - at about 7pm or 8pm. We specialise in using old materials, such as old bricks and unusual plants, to make gardens look as if they were built a long time ago. But sometimes people have a set idea of what they want, and it can be pretty horrible. Still, its very satisfying when we do a complete landscape from start to finish and then see all the blooms come out.
It’s hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business line when it rings. I never have any trouble sleeping because the work I do is so physical that I’m always exhausted at the end of the day. I wouldn't say I’m very strong, but I’m fit. Physically, it’s a very tough job, but it does let your imagination run wild.”

Name: Zena

Age: 27

ZENA'S DAY

“I arrive at the site by 8.30am. I’m assistant resident engineer at the site, so I’m looking after the building of a couple of bridges and a retaining wall - which prevents people driving off the road into a quarry. I check that the contractors are working to the schedule and specifications, with correct safety systems and minimum environmental impact. I help to co-ordinate the site professionals and find solutions to any problems.
The contractors start work at 6am, so my first task is to find out from the clerk of works what’s been going on since I left the night before. The rest of the day is a reaction to whatever he tells me. Usually there’s some paperwork from the contractors to look at, or there might be design queries to answer.
Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2pm and 2.30pm, but I tend to grab things to eat as I go along. The contractors have set mealtimes and when they’re off eating it’s easier to check things on site. Because we’re checking their work it can cause conflict, so our relationship has to be as open as possible. I see the duty resident engineer once a day. However, if something really important comes up I don’t wait to tell them before I act. I usually leave the site at about 6pm and Im on call all the time.",C1
"THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS
The best boat design should combine old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft, 'The Westerman'.
This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts, bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. By contrast, my own lies quietly on a tidal creek off the south coast. She was designed last year but, seeing her, you might imagine her to be 100 years old and think that her owner must be some kind of lost-soul romantic.
Perhaps I am, though I doubt it. This boat has benefited from all the magic of old-fashioned boat design, but it would have been a much harder job without the advances of modern know-how.
It has to be said, however, that despite being an indispensable tool in current design methods and boat-building practice, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life. These are often the very realities they hoped to rediscover by going to sea in the first place.
It's not that I'm suggesting that sailors should go back to enduring every hardship. It's always been important to me that my boats have a coal stove for warmth and dryness and cosy berths for sleeping. But why go cruising at all if every sail sets and furls itself?
The occasional battle with flapping canvas is surely part of a seaman's life. And for what purpose should we abandon common sense and move our steering positions from the security of the aft end to some vulnerable perch half-way to the bow? The sad answer is that this creates a cabin like that of an ocean liner, with space for a bed larger than the one at home.
For me a boat should always be a boat and not a cottage on the water. When I bought an earlier boat, Hirta, in which I circumnavigated Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner observed that she had every comfort, but no luxury. During my long relationship with her, Hirta taught me how wise he was.
Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity to speak of, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and absolutely no electronics, especially in the navigation department, yet she was the kindest, easiest boat that I have ever sailed at sea.
Back on land, however, it is a sad fact that the very antiquity of classic boats means that they need a lot of looking after. When I had a bad injury to my back, I realised that my IS-year love affair with her had to end. Searching for a younger replacement produced no credible contenders, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch.
The Westerman has never disappointed me. Although Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his right-hand man, are adept with computer-assisted design programs, Irens initially drew this boat on a paper napkin, and only later transferred his ideas to the computer. After this had generated a set of lines, he carved a model, just as boatyards did in the days of sail. Together we considered the primary embryonic vessel, then fed the design back into the electronic box for modification.
The next version was nearly right and by the time the final one appeared, the form was perfect. The completed boat has now crossed the North Atlantic and has won four out of her first six racing starts,
Her appearance is ageless, her motion at sea is a pleasure and her accommodation, much of it in reclaimed pitch pine, emanates an atmosphere of deep peace. Maybe this is because she was drawn purely as a sailing craft, without reference to any furniture we might put into her. That is the well-tried method of the sea.
In her timeless serenity, she is the living proof that it works; that there is no need to follow current fashions to find satisfaction. and that sometimes it pays to listen to the lessons of history.
Constructed in timber treated with a penetrating glue, she is totally impervious to water. Thus she has all the benefits of a glass fibre boat yet looks like, feels like and sails like the real thing. ",C1
"The Tartan Museum
The modern, cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened.
You cannot miss it. At first it was only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland that was unmissable, stuck on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its huge, yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings, topped by a hulk of a hanging garden. Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece', 'stunning'), cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. This winter, now that the inside is almost ready for the opening, the exhibitions themselves look set for a similar fate.
Forget the does-it-tell-a-nation's-story, is-it-chronological debate. The answers are definitely yes; it is a many-splendoured dream-coat of stories, each hung about a precious historic object, and there is an outline timescale that helps visitors get their bearings but does not strait-jacket the displays. And no, it does not let its lovely national treasures - such as Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver- get swamped in national pride.
The real issue here. assuming that the collections are properly preserved. is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to come back. Dr David Clarke. the head of exhibitions, insists that a visit should be a pleasurable. visual experience, and that it is designed not for specialists but for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this liberalism. Clarke is a convincing purist when it comes to what is on show. Mock-ups and scenes from the past that rely heavily on imagination are out. For Clarke. they are tantamount to 'giving a complete statement of certainty about what the past was like. which '. he explains, 'would be wrong. The public deserves the truth.' The result is that, at this museum. what you see is what the experts know. But the question for today's visitor is whether the objects' stories can be told vividly enough merely with explanation panels. captions and multi-media interpretation and using barely 30 computers in total around the museum.
Less than three days before the opening, it is still difficult to be sure. Some impressions are clear. though. and it is not just the panoramic views of Edinburgh Castle that take your breath away. Step inside and what immediately hits you is the sequence of spaces. Galleries open one into another. different sizes, different shapes. all with pale walls that are wood- panelled to look like large blocks of stone and inset with deep display cases. Shafts of daylight stream through arrow-slit windows and cascade down from the roof lights. There is room to ponder and enjoy every item on display.
Thanks to the 12-member Junior board. set up three years ago with 9- to l2-year-olds drawn from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. What the group really wanted was to be able to ride through the displays. Dr Clarke admits. They lost that one, but won a dedicated children's hands-on centre in what should have been the temporary exhibition gallery. As a result. the Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor. is the only temporary exhibition. Due to change after three years, it is a hotchpotch of objects chosen by Scottish people and other personalities as the items that have had most impact on life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister's suggestion was an electric guitar. Others went for televisions. Thermos flasks and favourite toys. Although the idea is fun. somehow it feels like a lightweight solution that has floated up to the top of the building. not a proper attempt to address serious issues. It may seem less frothy when the computerised bank of personal reasons and recollections goes live next week.
Overall. Dr Clarke seems right when he suggests that 'objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else'. As for the modernist architecture: it works brilliantly from the inside and the top, but whether it is in the right location is another matter.

"Tapping into a food supply

In the forests of Madagascar there lives a primate with a lifestyle remarkably like a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the primate, the rare and elusive aye-aye, bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae. The woodpecker, of course, uses its beak for chiselling into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey; the aye-aye, on the other hand, uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Though the aye-aye's strange way of feeding was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only now discovered how it locates the insects hidden inside the wood.
Dr Carl Erickson, of Duke University's Primate Center, has been investigating the hunting skills of two captive males, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her infant daughter, Annabelle (Animal Behaviour, vol. 41 pp. 793-802). He first tested whether they found insects just by looking for the telltale visual signs of their presence. For example, holes on the surface might indicate sites where female insects had entered the wood and laid their eggs. Dr Erickson presented the aye-ayes with logs in which he had drilled several narrow holes. Some holes led to cavities containing mealworms while others were blank dead-ends. The aye-ayes went straight for the cavities with food, gnawing through the wood and clearly not requiring the visual clues of surface holes.
Perhaps the aye-ayes were locating the mealworms by their smell or the sounds they were making. But further tests showed that they didn't use these clues either. Logs in which the smell of the insects was prevented from leaking out presented no problem, and the aye-ayes also located dead (and therefore silent) mealworms.
If they weren’t seeing, smelling or hearing the insects, how were the aye-ayes able to find them? Dr Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those containing mealworms. They could apparently sense the cavity itself.
When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. Dr Erickson suggests that the animal is echo-locating, listening and perhaps feeling for reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.
The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are birds, such as the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, which do probe for or glean insects from wood, and so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant. Not only can the aye-aye be regarded as a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat rolled into one, but it also behaves like a squirrel (indeed, it was originally classified as one). Its incisors grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has recently been observed in the wild gnawing through the shells of nuts, and extracting the meat of the nut with its elongated finger.",C1
"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet 
Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Yet one of his greatest accomplishments, in the eyes of his contemporaries, was to chart, using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore, the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now known as 'declination', that is, the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without it, sailors were unable to correct their compasses. It was therefore impossible to deduce longitude precisely and navigate the oceans.
So it was that Halley, one of only two men in the land at that time paid to conduct scientific research, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands with the grand plan of charting declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time.
This voyage took him and his crew to Rio de Janeiro, down past South Georgia, up again to Newfoundland and back to England. From these travels Halley published, in 170I, a 'New and Correct Chart shewing the Variations of the Compasse in the Western and Southern Oceans'. More sophisticated successors to this primitive cartographic effort proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century, before a slow change in the terrestrial magnetic field rendered them inaccurate.
If all goes well, Halley's accomplishments will be celebrated once again. Dr Clark, himself a keen sailor, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore.
£70,000 will have to be raised before he embarks, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is providing support for his efforts to do this. Dr Clark became fascinated by Halley during a two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read biographies of the great scientist. 
'Halley led a remarkable life: Dr Clark says. 'He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the positions of the stars, and also found time for other interests.'
It was during this period that Halley developed a diving bell and also advised Sir Isaac Newton during his writing of Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Recreating the voyage, Dr Clark says, will afford Halley the recognition he deserves. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific merit.
It will involve making the measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. These measurements need to be updated because the terrestrial magnetic field is slowly but constantly changing.
The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field, called the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. That's because you need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr Clark.
‘On our expedition we can use global positioning satellites to determine that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have offered to supply instruments. By chance, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements over the globe.
Dr Clark hopes that his measurements will plug any gaps in its coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and, he points out, it is also useful to have ground-based measurements as a comparison. It is easy to forget just how significant Halley's Atlantic journey really was. It was the first dedicated scientific expedition on the seas and Halley became the first civilian who was appointed naval captain to pursue what many regarded as an obsession with declination. Does Dr Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success?
As well as spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews.
And does he share Halley's obsessive trait? 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose.'

"Security was tight; armed guards watched the protestors. Many of the Klan members held signs demanding freedom for Sam Cayhall.
Donnie reported to the security guard. His name was checked, and a few minutes later a van came for him. His brother had been at Parchman for nine and a half years, and every month Donnie had sent Sam a box of cigarettes and some cash. He had tried to visit at least once a year, but he was ashamed to admit
that the last visit was two years ago.
Donnie Cayhall was sixty-one, the youngest of the four Cayhall brothers. All had followed the teachings of their father and joined the Klan in their teenage years. Later Donnie had traveled the world, and he had lost interest in the Klan.
He was searched, and shown to the front office, just inside the entrance to the Row. As the big day approached, prisoners were allowed to meet their visitors there, without a time limit. Sam was brought in a few minutes later, and the two men were left alone. Donnie put his arms around his brother tightly for a long time, and when he let go both men had tears in their eyes. They were of similar height and build, though Sam looked twenty years older. 
He sat on the desk, and Donnie sat near him. ""Any good news?"" Donnie asked, certain of the answer.
""No. None. The courts are turning everything down. They're going to do it, Donnie. They're going to kill me. They'll put me in the chamber and gas me like an animal.""
Donnie's face showed his disappointment. ""I'm sorry, Sam.""

"Three theories about sleep 

People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain, therefore, that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. 
There seem to be three main theories. The most popular states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. In other words, biological processes work hard as we sleep to repair any damage done during the day and to restore ourselves to full efficiency. However, a second theory places more emphasis on the learning benefits of sleep. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day, and asserts that, without sleep, learning would not take place. A third popular theory is based on ideas about energy, saying that we need periods of sleep in order to, in a sense, recharge our batteries and so have an adequate supply of energy for the coming day.

"Volunteer tourism 

Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. 
 
A.
It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. Whilst volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, they have usually paid a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work: money that, if donated to a local community directly, could potentially pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide. This is especially so in the case of gap years, in which the level of technical skill or professional experience required of volunteers is negligible. Hence, it is unsurprising that many academic studies allude to the moral issue of whether gap year volunteering is principally motivated by altruism – a desire to benefit the society visited – or whether young people aim to generate ‘cultural capital’ which benefits them in their careers. However, the projects may play a role in developing people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off. 

B.
Volunteering may lead to greater international understanding; enhanced ability to solve conflicts; widespread and democratic participation in global affairs through global civic society organisations; and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. In this scenario, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, an outcome where benefits accrue to volunteers and host communities, and contribute to the global greater good. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work. Those who volunteer will continue to reap its benefits, using host organisations and host communities as a rung on the ladder of personal advancement. 

C.
At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, volunteer tourism, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities. Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development. 
 
 
D.
Volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble ‘making a difference’, can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate. The personal element appears positive – it bypasses big government and eschews big business. Yet it also bypasses the democratic imperative of representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity, most often ones that seek to work around rather than transform the situations of poor, rural societies. Cynicism at the act of volunteering is certainly misplaced. The act of volunteer tourism may involve only simple, commendable charity. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development. The politics of volunteer tourism represents a retreat from a social understanding of global inequalities and the poverty lived by so many in the developing word. ",C1

GIIANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN

Ghanerao Hotel sits at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small rural village dominated by craftsmen. It mixes English country-house tranquillity with Indian symbolism. The Ghanerao family have lived there for 400 years and today, Sajjan Singh and his wife have opened their home to paying guests. The facilities are basic, with hot water arriving by bucket, but the spartan aspects of life at Ghanerao just add to its appeal.

HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK

One of my favourite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zcaland’s South Island which I came across by chance when I was climbing. We had been flown up to near the top of a glacier and had climbed to the peak and then had to walk all the way down. When we finally reached the bottom, to my astonishment, there was this hotel. It was on its own in the most stupendously beautiful countryside, very wild and very high up. To come down the mountain battered and exhausted and find yourself in extreme luxury, with a man playing Cole Porter on the piano, was extraordinary.

BEACI ICOMBER PARADIS HOTEL

On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is isolated on its own peninsula in one of the quietest corners of the island. If you drive from here, the road winds along the coast past beaches with no-one on them but fishermen.
The hotel isn’t small and there are plenty of takers for the free watersports, but you can easily escape from all the other people along nine kilometres of private beach; you have only to swim a few yards out into the Indian Ocean and you can barely see the hotel for palm trees. Sit on the beach in the evening when everyone has gone and as the light drains from the sky you’ll feel far away from everything.

Overnight guests have been known to arrive, take one look at the gardens, the bedrooms and the dining-hall menu, and decide on the spot to stay for a week. There are even apartments set aside specially for those who make up their minds to settle in for a few months. The hotel’s leafy acres and scattered buildings are laid out on Nairobi Hill, a world away from the overhead bustle of the city centre.

"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?

We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said.

Publisher A

Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The Book Marketing Council found some years ago that when questioned on why they had bought a particular hook, more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence (advertisements, word of mouth, bookshop display, etc.).
Authors' responses to reviews are slightly different from publishers. Both are devastated by no reviews, but publishers are usually more equable about the had reviews, judging that column inches are what matter and that a combination of denunciation and ecstatic praise can actually create sales as readers decide to judge for themselves.
Publishers probably get the most pleasure from a review which precisely echoes their own response to a book - they are often the first ‘reader’.

Publisher B

While publishers and the press fairly obviously have a common interest in the nature of book review pages, one also needs to remember that their requirements substantially differ: a newspaper or magazine needs to provide its readers with appropriately entertaining material; a publishing house wants to see books, preferably its own, reviewed, preferably favourably.
Without any question, book reviewing is ‘better’ — more diverse, less elitist — than 40 years ago, when I began reading review pages. That said, there is still a long-grumbled-about tendency to neglect the book medium read by a majority — namely paperbacks. The weekly roundups aren’t really adequate even if conscientiously done. And even original paperbacks only rarely receive serious coverage.
But publishers shouldn’t complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews, which after all are an economical way of getting a book and an author known. There is no question that a lively account of a new book by a trusted name can generate sales even more if there are several of them. Fame is what puts a book into the hands of readers.

Publisher C

Reviews are the oxygen of literary publishing; without them, we would be cut off from an essential life-source. Because the books we publish are generally not by ‘brand-name’ authors, whose books sell with or without reviews, and because we seldom advertise, we depend on the space given to our books by literary editors.
When the reviews are favourable, of course, they are worth infinitely more than any advertisement. The reader knows that the good review is not influenced by the publisher’s marketing budget: it is the voice of reason, and there is no doubt that it helps to sell books. Publishers themselves often claim that they look for size rather than content in reviews.
The actual effect of reviews on sales is the inscrutable heart of the whole business. Good reviews can launch a book and a career and occasionally lift sales into the stratosphere: but never entirely on their own. There has to be some fusion with other elements — a word-of-mouth network of recommendation, a robust response from the book trade, clever marketing.

Publisher D

The relationship in Britain between publishing and reviewing? I wish I knew! In the United States it’s simple: the New York Times can make or break a book with a single review. Here, though, the people in the bookshops often don’t appear to take much notice of them.
It sometimes takes 20 years of consistently outstanding reviews for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet some of the most dismally received books, or books not yet reviewed, are the biggest sellers of all. So it’s all very unpredictable, though non-action is less so.
Mind you, non-fiction does allow reviewers to indulge themselves by telling us what they know about the subject of the book under review rather than about the book itself.

Publisher E

Of course, all publishers and all writers dream of long, uniformly laudatory reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography. The reviews were everything I could have craved. The book was a flop — because everyone thought that, by reading the lengthy reviews, they need not buy the book.
Does the name of the reviewer make a difference? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, the public seemed to take note and obey their recommendations. These days, it is as much the choice of an unexpected reviewer, or the sheer power or wit or originality of the review, which urges the prospective buyer into the bookshop.",C1
"Hedgehogs 

A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world, none is native to either America or Australia. 
All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked, so that their spines point outwards. The effectiveness of this as a defence mechanism, depends, of course, on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. 
Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

"WEATHERVANE MAKER

THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill, going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. ‘That way I can produce a unique personalised item,’ he explains. ‘A lot of my customers are women buying presents for their husbands. They want a distinctive gift that represents the man’s business or leisure interests.’
It’s all a far cry from the traditional cockerel, the most common design for weathervanes.
It was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick that featured on the first weathervane Graham ever made. Friends admired his surprise present for his wife and began asking him to make vanes for them. ‘I realised that when it came to subjects that could be made into them, the possibilities were limitless,’ he says.
Graham decided to concentrate his efforts on a weathervane business. He had sewed an apprenticeship as a precision engineer and had worked in that trade for 15 years when he and his wife, Liz, agreed to swap roles - she went out to work as an architectural assistant and he stayed at home to look after the children and build up the business.
That was five years ago and he has no regrets about his new direction. ‘My previous work didn’t have an artistic element to it, whereas this is exciting and creative,’ he says. ‘I really enjoy the design side.’
Graham has now perfected over 100 original designs. He works to very fine detail, always seeking approval for the design of the silhouette from the customer before proceeding with the hand-cutting.
Graham also keeps plenty of traditional designs in stock, since they prove as popular as the one-offs. ‘It seems that people are attracted to hand-crafting,’ Graham says. ‘They welcome the opportunity to acquire something a little bit different.’
Graham has no plans for expansion, as he wants to keep the business as a rural craft.
‘I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality and I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a nondescript shape turn into something almost lifelike,’ he says.
‘For centuries, weathervanes have kept communities in touch with the elements signalling those shifts in wind direction that bring about changes in the weather,’ he explains.
‘And nowadays, with more and more people moving to the country, individuals want to put an exclusive finishing touch to their properties. It has been a boost to crafts like mine.’
Graham has become increasingly busy, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide.
American and Danish buyers in particular are showing interest. ‘Pricing,’ he explains, ‘depends on the intricacy of the design.’ His most recent request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a gift with a difference.",C1

Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases
A
Abyss
Long before Titanic, director James Cameron made this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks. Production design and special effects are hugely impressive. It's only the dialogue and characterisation that creak For all the craftsmanship which goes Into the film-making, the story Itself IS strictly B-movie material.
B
The Thin Red Line
The video release of this version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal directed by Andrew Marton makes a fascinating counterpart to Terrence Malick's new film. Whereas Malick's approach IS mystical and poetic, Marton made a much more conventional war movie. albeit one that is often truer to the book. He concentrated on a single soldier, and on his relationship with his abrasive sergeant. Malick's film IS Infinitely richer and more complex, but Marton's version has ItS moments. The flashback sequence, In which the soldier dreams of the wife he longs for, is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus Imagery of the woman on the swing.
C
On Guard
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this corny but highly watchable swashbuckler IS a cut above most musketeer adventures It has a consummate villain In Fabrice Luchini's clammy politician, orchestrating death and destruction behind the scenes Vincent Perez makes an exuberant (If rather short-lived) hero, and while Daniel Auteuil is perhaps too moody a presence for a romp like this, he too has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film-makers peddle costume-drama cliches with so much Wit and sparkle It never seems to matter.
D
Character
A handsome but dour tale, set In turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The excessively detailed production and costume design leave the film looking like a museum piece. Taking his cue from the surroundings, Jan Decleir is endlessly morose as the brutal bailiff Dreverhaven, who behaves ruthlessly when evICting tenants. HIS antagonistic relationship with his son IS at the core of the story, but the film-makers seem too busy laYing on the period detail to do Justice to the dark and vicious parable.
E
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
This digitally re-mastered video re-release shows off director Leone's craftsmanship to ItS best advantage. The sound editing, in particular, stands out every footstep, creaking floorboard or barking dog registers loud and clear. The storytelling IS relentlessly cruel and whenever there's a lull, It only takes a burst of Morricone's magnificent music to quicken the pulse On a moral level, there Isn't much to distinguish between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef) and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all of whom seem equally unscrupulous as they maraud across the post- Civil War West.
F
The Longest Day
'Forty-eight International stars' trumpets the publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic. With four directors and 23,000 extras as well, this is one pudding which is definitely over-egged The early sequences, in which the battle-hardened veterans walt for confirmation of when the invasion will happen, drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers. On a logistical level (If not an aesthetic one), this is an impressive enough feat but it cries out for the big screen Panned and scanned on video, It is inevitably a diminished experience.

"New In Paperback

A.
The career of citizen Tristan Smith, set in the fictional republic of Efica, is an extraordinary parable of human power, history and humour. In a feat of considerable literary skill, the author has created a world with its own history, traditions and customs.
The book is notable also for its humour, and for the author’s unique vision, which is here combined with his penetrating psychological insight in a novel which is difficult but rewarding.

B. 
Harriet is poised and middle-class, with an architect husband and her own business. 
Ordinarily, she would never have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who looks after her ageing father and has brought up her grandson, Leo, since he was three.
Their lives are shattered when the teenage Leo viciously attacks Harriets son, Joe, in the street. After the court case both boys refuse to talk about what happened. Leo, who had been a model pupil and had never been involved in a fight before, will not explain what came over him, while Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is tortured by the effect on her son and ministering to him takes over her life. Sheila is so wracked with guilt that she requests a meeting - from which their unusual friendship grows.
The great strength of the author has always been in depicting how people react to upheaval in their lives. He also captures the mothers sense that, no matter how hard she tries, she can never do enough.

C.
Shortlisted for the Booker prize, this book follows the fortunes of one of the most isolated of the Scottish Orkney islands and its inhabitants over a long and uneventful rural history.
The book sets this narrative against pertinent moments in Scottish history, as vividly imagined in the daydreams of the young protagonist, Throfinn
Ragnarson, who disappears abruptly at one point in the book, only to return after the Second World War, having now learnt to appreciate the simplicity of his worthy ancestors lives.

D.
Following his recent blockbuster success, the author has produced a sequel resonant with the same gentle irony and acid observations of family life which made its predecessor so appealing.
Fifteen years after her daughter’s death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her spirited companion, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life remains the same winning combination of vanity, charm and reluctant kindness, and Rosie provides an ally in her continuing and highly enjoyable manipulation of both suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora is forced to acknowledge the passage of time that brings a new generation to centre stage.
The author is skilful at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events.

E.
Six disparate people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the islands of the South Pacific in his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. With her awe-inspiring mastery of descriptive language, the author charts the personal voyages of self-discovery with which each of these mariners prepares to return home, their own spirits quickened and made ardent by the experience of life adrift on ‘the desert cities of waves’.
The author uses startling images to convey her themes of memory and awareness. Those images are both alienating and illuminating.",C1
"An awfully big adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it, and lived to tell the tale.

There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children’s stories used to specialise in them — courageous explorers with sunburnt, leathery skin and eyes narrowed by straining to see into far horizons on their journeys into the unknown. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore’s great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across one of the last unexplored places on earth, the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means ‘once entered you never come out’, but local people call it the Desert of Death. He recalled the dangers and exhilaration of that amazing trek, in the calm atmosphere of his family home.
The team he led was composed of four Britons (one of them the party’s medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese (all experts on the area), 30 camels and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before, but were long-distance lorry drivers: a misunderstanding that could have cost everyone their lives and certainly jeopardised the expedition’s success. This mixed bunch set out to cross 1,200 kilometres of the world’s least hospitable desert and Charles Blackmore has written a mesmerising account of their journey. 
At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He launched the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. ‘I had always assumed I’d spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered promotion but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a tremendous gamble. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the event, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.’
Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word ‘kind’. The team suffered unspeakable hardships: dysentery; extremes of temperature; severe thirst and dehydration; the loss of part of their precious water supply. ‘But’, Blackmore explains, ‘when we were at the limits of our own endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn’t experience the Taklamakan’s legendary sandstorms. And we never hit the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally immobilised us. That’s not to say that we weren’t fighting against hurdles the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily laden camels, which often rolled over onto us.
‘What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no contingency plan. Neither our budget no time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills we were completely on our own.
‘I knew I had the mental stamina for the trip but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one — we sat at the edge of the desert and it was such an inferno that you couldn’t breathe. I thought, “We’ve got to do it now!” At that moment I was a very scared man.’
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? ‘When you’ve walked for 1,000 kilometres you’re not going to duck out. You’ve endured so much; you’ve got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and sinewy despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.’
Midway through the book, Blackmore went on to describe lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How conscious was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? ‘Inside me there’s someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievements, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve dine. Yet in terms of a lifetime’s achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share — against that yardstick, the desert does not measure up, does not compare.’
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ‘I yearn for the challenge — for the open spaces — the resolve of it all. We were buoyed up by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.’",C1
"BRINGING UP BADGERS

‘What now?’ was my immediate thought, as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago, we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box — a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads.
I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her.
I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours.
Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ‘mum’, they seemed very contented. Three weeks after their arrival, however, I noticed that Willow seemed lethargic, although he was still taking food as normal. It was a warning sign. I should have reacted straightaway; not realising its importance, I awoke the next morning to find him dead.
The vets post mortem revealed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle feeding any animal it is important not to let it drink too fast, as liquid can overflow into the lungs. In Willows case this had caused an infection that would have been difficult to rectify, even with the help of antibiotics, in one so small.
Disheartened by my failure, I continued rearing the others. But fate works in strange ways: six days later a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. Behind some silage bags he had discovered a single male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return; the area had been disturbed too much and already the cub was cold and hungry.
Willow II joined the fold. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females and over the next few days I discovered why his mother had left him. Never had anything been so difficult to feed. To place the bottles teat in his mouth and cajole him into drinking I had to keep moving it around and squeezing it. After a full 10 minutes he would latch on to it as if he had not drunk all day. By the end of April the females were weaned on to creamed rice and then literally anything. It was to be a different story for Willow. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food, tipping it over or just sitting in it. Eventually I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages he was ready to move on to something else.
At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast; a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. The usual diet for badgers is 60 per cent earthworms, plus beetles and bugs, baby rabbits, mice and voles and even shoots or roots of plants. Certainly my badgers were much better off than other cubs that year; the summer was exceptionally hot and digging for earthworms must have been almost impossible.
By August my foundlings had begun to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often went through the cider orchard; in its long grass, everyone was fair game. The cubs would get excited, ruffle up their fur so that they looked like snowballs and chase each other’s tails. As ‘human badgers’ we were included in this sport. I learnt to avoid those playful charges that ended with a sharp nip, but Derek accompanied us only occasionally and so never grasped this skill: his reactions to being caught were sometimes as colourful as his bruises.
It was during two of these late-night walks in the very dry period that I spotted odder badgers in our field. Presumably they were having to extend their territories to find enough food, although badgers are very territorial and will kill others that wander into their territory. We were even warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so sheet metal was placed over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers, and such was the response that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With advice freely given, we designed our badgers’ new home. Daniel, one of our sons, drew up the plans and we built a sett complete with tunnels, an enclosure and a badger gate facing the same way as their nightly walks.
It had three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass side to enable people to see into the sett from a darkened enclosure. As the sett began to take shape, the badgers would explore it before going on their walks. Eventually walks were forgotten in the excitement of climbing through the tunnels and sorting out bedding.
The cost of the building work was far more than we envisaged but a local bus company (the aptly named Badgerline) sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated building materials. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own.
Early one evening they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later I crept back to see if all was well, to be met with the sight of three badgers curled up in their chambers sound asleep.
These days my walks with them are not as regular, especially as they are not fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally (she has joined a neighbouring sett) but
Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, an area that they have come to know well and a home they have readily accepted.",C1
"Margaret was aged just 13 when she married the 30-year-old King James IV.
In deference to her age, James kept his existing mistress. Margaret's first pregnancy was not for several years. They had six children together, but only one survived infancy, the future James V.
The marriage was supposed to seal the perpetual peace, but a decade later it was put to the test.
Margaret's brother Henry VIII was now the English king. When France went to war with England, James picked the French side and invaded Northumberland.
The pattern of Scotland's position throughout the 16th Century was confirmed, a satellite pulled between France and England.
James IV's decision led to disaster. His army was defeated at Flodden Field in 1513 and James was killed.
Margaret's young son was not old enough to be king, so she became regent of Scotland, and the first Tudor woman to rule a kingdom.
But her position was precarious. The Scots Council wanted a military leader, not a female regent.
The Scottish nobles wanted the powerful Duke of Albany to rule. He was next in line to the throne but Margaret feared that meant he might dispose of her sons and become king.
Margaret needed powerful backing to oppose Albany's return and planned to marry to get it.
She chose the Earl of Angus. He had a strong following, but when the news emerged of Margaret's marriage she lost her popularity as the King's widow, and under the terms of her late husband's will, her remarriage meant she also lost the regency.",C1
"Careers

Six people talk about their typical working day

A. Credit Card Executive

I get up at 6 am to arrive at the office around 7.30 am. I manage all the customer development programmes for our regular credit card users. My responsibilities include the launch and management of the Membership Rewards scheme in the major European markets. I have to keep in touch with existing card users, acquire new ones and build relationships with partner companies.
I use the first 45 minutes to organise my day and then I respond to any e-mail messages. I manage all the advertising for the membership programme across Europe, so I meet with our marketing staff and the advertising agencies to establish a strategy and work on future developments. I have meetings scheduled for most of the day, but at all other times I make sure I keep my door open for anyone to come and ask me questions.
There are nine customer service units around Europe and I have to travel to the different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues that come up. When I’m in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

B. Record Company Executive

I get to work for 10.00 am and go through the post - between ten and twenty demonstration tapes a day, letters from producers and information about concerts, as well as invoices from session musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing at about 10.30 am - producers, publishers and so on, and there are meetings arranged throughout the day to talk about campaigns or projects for a particular artist. This might involve the press, marketing and the managing director.
When I listen to demo tapes I am very aware that people are bringing in their life's work, so I try to be constructive. I instinctively know if the sound is appropriate for our record label. Once I've signed a band, we start on the first album - choosing the songs, producer, and additional musicians. Then I have to communicate my vision of the album to the rest of the company for marketing and selling. I also oversee budgets and spending.
I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and most evenings I go to gigs - sometimes I see as many as five new groups a night. Sometimes after a gig I’ll visit an artist in the studio. Most of my socialising evolves around my work. I often don’t get home until 1.00 am - when I put on a record to help me wind down.

C. Sales Director

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work to arrive at 9.30 am. I open the post, look through the diary to check if we’re going to see any clients that day, then wait and see who turns up.
I love taking people round the showrooms - there’s nothing better than reaching an agreement with someone, selling them a piece of furniture and knowing it’s going to a good home. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from the London salerooms, country house sales, our private clients and overseas.
A lot of what we buy needs restoration. We have a full-time restorer in the shop, and I spend a lot of time liaising with gilders, picture framers and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while I drink coffee at odd moments, to keep in touch with what’s going on in the business, and I often pop into the Victoria and Albert museum to compare furniture.
I do the accounts one day every month and every three months I do the tax returns. At 5.30 pm I go home. It usually takes me about an hour to switch off.

D. Air Traffic Controller

I work a set shift pattern, and when I’m on an early shift I leave the house at 6.00 am. At 7.00 am I relieve the night shift and take over one of the four control positions in the tower.
We have a rotating timetable, which means that I work for about an hour and a half at one of the stations, go off for half an hour and then come back to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor and the watch manager all sit near to each other and work as a team, controlling the aircraft movements.
In winter we deal with about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are much quieter, and I usually get a chance to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am.
It’s important to be really switched on in this job, so even if I’m only a bit under the weather I have no qualms about being off sick. I find the work quite stressful and it can take a while to wind down at the end of a shift. Eventually I’d like to be watch manager, and then maybe even general manager of the airport.

E. Shop Manager

If I’m on an early shift, I leave the house by 8.00 am. The first thing I do is get the electronic point-of-sale system up and running.
I always make sure there’s someone to watch the till and I co-ordinate people’s lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers, finding and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, although it can be a bit annoying if they come in waving reviews and expect you to run around gathering a pile of books for them.
Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm most weekdays, publishers’ reps come into the shop and I spend some time discussing new titles for the months ahead. I have to consider how many, if any, of a particular title the shop is likely to sell. When we want to feature a new title, it’s essential that I make sure it’s delivered in time.
The early shift finishes at 5.45 pm. Two days a week I do a late shift, and then I close down the computer system, lock up and go home.

F. Financial Analyst

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to arrive at work at 8.45 am. First I get in touch with our freelance reporters to find out what is happening in the region I’m responsible for.
I assess financial risk for multi-national companies operating abroad, so it is my job to try to warn clients well in advance of anything that could go wrong in that country. I provide three services: an on-line executive preview, or newsflash; a security forecast, which is an extended preview plus a forecast for the next six months; and a travel information security guide.
From 9.15 am to 9.30 am I meet with our editors to discuss the stories I’m going to follow. My first executive preview has to be on-line by 10.00 am and my second deadline is 11.00 am, so I have to be quick chasing up stories. I type them, send them through to my editor, who edits and approves them, then I re-check and make any necessary alterations before they go through the system. 
I travel to Africa about three times a year, to report on specific events or just to keep up with what is happening. I leave work at around 6.00 pm. It’s quite difficult to switch off and most evenings I’m still awake at 1.00 am.",C1

""You've already talked to her.""
""Every day. We're a package. She's covered in the five million.""
Hark closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. ""I don't object to your five million. I just don't know how we can get it to you. I need to think about this.""
""I'm in no hurry,"" Snead said. ""I'll give you a week. If you say no, then I'll go to the other side.""
""There is no other side.""

"RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE
Health farms and country house hotels offering spa facilities report that business is booming. We asked five journalists to check out some of the places that are available.

A. HENLOW GRANGE

I welcomed the opportunity to go to Henlow Grange for six days as I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the main part of the huge 18th-century house was the most comfortable possible and I was instantly soothed.
On Day One I did nothing and slept lots. But from Day Two I started going to body conditioning and doing as many classes as I could (stretch and tone, yoga, body alignment, to name but a few). All the instructors are highly trained. I couldn't believe how supple I began to feel as the week progressed.
They have every possible treatment, including aromatherapy (I've never been so relaxed), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial, which lasts for an hour, really does make you feel like a new person.
The staff in the treatment rooms deserve a bouquet. T hey couldn't have been friendlier, nicer or more professional. The whole atmosphere is one of vitality and enthusiasm. Henlow are planning a major refurbishment this year, which will include a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available and you can ride around the grounds. If you're not feeling energetic and the weather's on your side, grab a magazine or enjoy a peaceful walk in the garden.
During my stay, my mood improved and so did my appetite. l left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted for ages. I’m definitely due another visit. This is the perfect break for the stressed working woman. Save
Room 5 for me!

B. SHRUBLAND HALL

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was evident from the moment I climbed the vast staircase into the reception area. The Hall has an impressively decorated library, a charming conservatory and lots of space, so you don’t have to speak to anyone if you don't want to.
On arrival everybody is given a medical, which includes an examination and a check on weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which I found a bit disquieting as I’m in good health. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem discovered in the examination was immediately passed on to the fitness instructor and we worked on it in the group workshops and also in an extra session of individual instruction.
Each patient is given a specific diet to follow. Although I lost weight without fasting, I was still hungry enough to develop a fierce headache on the second day. A typical daily menu for me was a breakfast of grapefruit and honey, hot lemon and boiled water; a choice of salads for lunch; and a mixture of exotic fruit, yoghurt and a flask of hot broth for supper. If you’re not fasting or on a light diet, then you’ll eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and nicely presented, so you needn’t suffer too much! You have a massage or water therapy on alternate days. All extra treatments are competitively priced.

C. CAREYS MANOR

Careys is not a health farm and doesn’t pretend to be. It’s a fine old manor farm with inviting log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're counting calories, you'll have to miss out on the gourmet food. Rich sauces and delightful creamy confections are conjured up by the French chef. It's a good job the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and soft-water pool so I could work off some of the tempting indulgences. (You can opt for a ‘health-conscious’ diet if you really want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got an expert opinion on an old, sometimes painful, shoulder injury. The physiotherapist recommended good posture, remedial exercises and massage. Carey’s manages to be comfortable and luxurious, laid-back and sedate. If you want to break out, there is great surrounding countryside to explore.

D. CLIVEDEN

Cliveden is a majestic country home and is also a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and much more. There are stunning woodland walks and gardens around the 376-acre National Trust estate.
And there’s Waldo’s, a highly-acclaimed restaurant with dishes to make you clutch your stomach. In ecstasy. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu; the choice was staggering. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice-cream. I climbed into bed a happy woman!
Next morning I dutifully spent a few hours in the gym playing with exercise equipment to burn off a few calories in time for my next meal. In the Pavilion I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils. Then I had an aromatherapy massage. 
I thought of all the other reports my fellow journalists would make, about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone and firm the body. Cliveden has all these if you want to use them — before indulging yourself at Waldo’s.

E. SPRINGS HYDRO

The best and the worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it really is the most delicious I’ve ever tasted. The worst, because it’s a huge slab of 360 calories, which sets you back if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the fabulous aromatherapy massage. I chose the relaxing oils blend, dropped off to sleep twice during the massage, floated back to my room and had my most refreshing night’s sleep in years.
The premises are modern and purpose-built, efficiently run, with up-to-the-minute facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are plenty of therapists and beauty rooms so there’s little difficulty in scheduling appointments. A variety of treatments are on offer, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are an eclectic mix — from entire football teams to mums and daughters, best friends and singles. Ideally, I would have a break here about once a month.

"Henry was acutely aware of the importance of securing a male heir during his reign. He was worried that he had only one surviving child, Mary, to show for his marriage to Catherine, who was now in her 40s. So the king asked Cardinal Wolsey to appeal to Pope Clement VII for an annulment and it soon became clear he wanted to marry Anne Boleyn, who had been a lady-in-waiting to his first wife.
But, unwilling to anger Catherine of Aragon's nephew – the most powerful ruler in Europe, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V – the Pope refused. Thomas Wolsey's ascendancy was cut short by this failure.
In 1533, Henry VIII broke with the church and married the now pregnant Anne Boleyn in a secret ceremony. Henry was excommunicated by the Pope. The English reformation had begun.
After Wolsey's downfall, Thomas Cromwell became Henry's chief minister and earned the confidence of the King by helping him to break with Rome and establish Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. This act also brought him much needed wealth through the dissolution of the well-funded monasteries. Over four years Cromwell ordered that 800 monasteries be disbanded and their lands and treasures taken for the crown.
The cultural and social impact was significant, as much of the land was sold to the gentry and churches and monasteries were gutted and destroyed. Henry's personal religious beliefs remained Catholic, despite the growing number of people at court and in the nation who had adopted Protestantism.",C1
"The Cabinet-Maker
Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him
Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop, tucked under a railway arch in East London, and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well, fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. But a glance around the workshop reveals that Hurst is obviously busy, with good reason not to waste a minute of his time.
The arched space is full of half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in an amazing array of natural colours. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built up a very nice reputation for himself. His order book is always full for several months in advance, despite the fact that he does not really promote himself. Word has spread that if you want a decent cupboard or table, bookcase or kitchen units, Hurst is your man.
Of course, finding a furniture-maker is not that taxing a task. Wherever you live in the countryside, the craft is alive and well. But finding a cabinet- maker who prides himself on making beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines is less easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says wearily. As a craftsman who sets himself exacting standards, he is continually disappointed by some contemporary furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He rails against shoddy, mass-produced furniture, and craftsmen who churn out second-rate pieces.
Such a quest for perfection is obviously a key to Hurst's success. That and his talent. This man is not coy about his ability. Indeed, his blatant self- confidence is as surprising as his initial brusque manner. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says, with a deadpan expression. 'I have always been good at making things.' If it were not for the self-deprecating mood into which he slipped towards the end of our interview, I would have believed his conceit to be wholly genuine.
Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says nonchalantly. Almost all of his commissions come from private individuals ('l used to do some commercial work for companies but it was soul-destroying'). Some clients have returned time and again. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he is honest enough to admit that relationships with clients do not always run smoothly. 'The most infuriating clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favourite clients are the exacting ones.'
If Hurst has every reason to be pleased with himself, he is also gracious in his praise for others - where it is due. With a sudden shot of modesty, he says: 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham’ (the leading college of furniture design). However, he is also unremittingly critical of those craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also has little time for degree shows, in which students exhibit their work but at the same time are 'trying to make fashion statements. That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.’
Confident Hurst may be, even brusque, but you could never call him or his work pretentious. Indeed, his parting shot displays a welcome down- to-earth approach to his craft and a streak of humility strangely at odds with his earlier self- confidence. 'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says as I make my exit.",C1
"So England by the mid 1520s was hearing grumbles of lay dissatisfaction, grumbles that remained. Catholicism addressed many important needs and enjoyed general popular support. Even though the grumblers could point to Europe as a lead, the same situation existed in France, yet that remained Catholic. What France didn't have was a Defender of the Faith; it didn't have a Henry. King since 1509, England's Renaissance Man lacked but one thing in his life - a son. Catherine of Aragon had produced six children but only a daughter, Mary, survived. Henry had become convinced that God was punishing him for marrying the wife of his dead elder brother, Arthur. He had also become infatuated with Anne Boleyn, daughter of a well-connected London merchant whose family he knew well: her sister had been a mistress. No beauty but no fool, Anne insisted that she be Queen or nothing. Henry was keen. He was also married. It was his search for a solution that triggered the break from Rome.
In 1527 he asked Pope Clement VII for a divorce on Scriptural grounds. But unfortunately for both Clement and Henry, Rome was surrounded by the Emperor Charles V of Spain, Catherine's nephew. Unsurprisingly, Charles was unsympathetic to Henry's requests, which meant the Pope had to be as well. Henry had to find another way.
It was Thomas Cranmer, one of the White Horse Group, who in 1530 suggested a legal approach. The Collectanea argued that Kings of England enjoyed Imperial Power similar to that of the first Christian Roman Emperors. This meant that the Pope's jurisdiction was illegal: if Henry wanted a divorce, he could have it, as long as the Archbishop of Canterbury agreed. ",C1
"The December cover of Capitol Magazine featured Clay Carter, looking rich and handsome in his expensive Armani suit. Inside there were pictures of him playing with a dog (borrowed from Rodney), standing proudly in empty courtrooms, washing his new Porsche, and standing on board his new boat in the Bahamas. 
Near the back of the same magazine were pictures of brides, followed by announcements of future weddings. There was a picture of Rebecca Van Horn, looking beautiful, sitting on a bench next to her future husband, an insignificant but rich-looking man called Jason Schubert Myers. 
Clay smiled to himself at the misery the magazine must, at that moment, be causing in the Van Horn home. Bennett and Barbara Van Horn wanted the whole world to be impressed by their daughter's wedding, but who was on the front cover of the same magazine? Clay Carter, the man who Bennett had called a loser. 
Revenge was sweet. But his revenge wasn't finished yet. ""I'm looking for a young woman, preferably a blonde,"" Clay said to Jonah after work that Wednesday evening. Jonah was surprised. ""The richest young bachelor in town is having trouble finding a woman?"" ""I'm going to Rebecca's wedding, and I need a beautiful young woman to go with me."" 
Jonah knew hundreds of beautiful women, and he showed Clay a photograph in a magazine of a girl called Ridley-a twenty-five-year-old fashion model from Russia who had come to America as a student and who had never gone back.

"With the trees, I planted my stake in New Zealand

JONATHON PORRITT

TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER

Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'.
I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot, which was great, because I like winter.
My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which ‘the kids’, my brother, sister and I, could look after. Mother said, ‘If you can take the time and trouble to plant it with trees then you can have it.' The idea was that we would always have a stake in New Zealand, which is a lovely idea as my father was actually brought up there. And they found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. It's rather poor land, really, but it’s quite good for planting trees on.
I’ve always been very keen and enthusiastic about land. I'd spent a year in Australia working on sheep stations and helping out in different farming jobs, and so the idea of planting trees sounded like a very nice idea, and I was immediately keen. I think the rest of the family got enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres.
In New Zealand in 1968 it was one of those winters. It rained an awful lot, endlessly in fact, and in a way it’s idiotic to think back on it as such an immensely happy time as it rained pretty well most days that we were planting, and I don't suppose I’ve ever been wetter or colder for such a prolonged period.
There was a moment of truth every morning: getting ready for the next planting session. Coming out of the Land Rover relatively warm and dry, with the rain coming down, and your anorak still clammy from the day before, boots still sodden, hands fumbling with slippery laces.
‘The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts, ideas and reflections about life.'
In that first year I had a guy to work with me who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful as I’d never planted trees seriously before all this. You have a planting bag around your neck which you fill with as many trees as you possibly can, and when your bag is full it's a nightmare, and it’s only as it gets lighter that life gets easier.
In a way, the most difficult bit of the entire operation was getting the lines straight. You work out what spacing you’re going to plant the trees at, and then you line up a series of three poles across as long a trajectory as you can get, and those poles then determine your lines. Once you're in line, you just plant all the way down the line till you get to the end, turn around and come back again. I enjoy hard physical work, and it certainly made me fit.
After a certain point you can plant trees almost on automatic, you become used to a rhythm, and you use the minimum number of spade strokes that you need to get the hole in the ground. The rhythm is something that everybody tells you about and, of course, it's true of many agricultural jobs that you actually have to train the body into a series of quite standardised moves, and then it becomes immensely easy: so you develop an absolutely regular process of taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it in, and moving on. Mentally, it’s very interesting. The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts and ideas and reflections about life - a lot of my thinking about the natural world and our place in it, all of those things that have since dominated my life, first began to pop through my head in those days.
I’ve been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees gradually grow, which has been very satisfying when you actually planted the things and you do then have a kind of stake in what happens and how they prosper.
I always dread reading in the newspapers stories of another high wind in New Zealand, or Worst Drought Ever Hits New Zealand. Such headlines make me feel extremely apprehensive. However, it worked out extremely well and those trees are now 20 years old, and in good fettle.
The only postscript I should add is that I took a term off from teaching, and I went back there in 1984, completely on my own for three months. And I wrote my first book there, Seeing Green. There’s a little cabin on the tree farm which is fantastically basic, just a bed, a table and a chair. In the mornings I would do my writing; in the afternoons I would go off and prune the trees, and then do research in the evenings.
The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong. In many respects it's the place that I feel most closely identified with in terms of that link between people and the earth: it's a most powerful bond.",C1
"Lexington, who had always done everything his aunt had told him, put the money in his pocket, put on a pair of shoes and a clean shirt, and went down the mountain to the village where the doctor lived.
'Old Glosspan?' the doctor said. 'Is she dead?'
'Certainly she's dead,' the boy answered. 'If you come home with me now I'll dig her up and you can see for yourself.'
'How deep did you bury her?' the doctor asked. 'Two or three metres down, I think.' 
'And how long ago?' 'Oh, about eight hours.' 'Then she's dead,' the doctor announced. 'Here's the certificate.'
Lexington now left for the city of New York to find Mr Samuel Zuckermann. He travelled on foot, and he slept under bushes, and he lived on berries and wild plants, and it took him sixteen days to reach the city.
'What a place this is!' he cried, as he stood staring around him. 'There are no chickens or cows anywhere and none of the women looks like Aunt Glosspan at all.'
Lexington had never seen anyone like Mr Zuckermann before, either. He was a small man with a large nose, and when he smiled, bits of gold flashed at you from lots of different places inside his
mouth. In his office, he shook Lexington warmly by the hand and congratulated him on his aunt's death.
'I suppose you know that your dearly loved aunt was a woman of great wealth?' he said.
'Do you mean the cows and the chickens?'
'I mean five hundred thousand dollars,' Mr Zuckermann said.
'How much?'
'Five hundred thousand dollars, my boy. And she's left it all to you.'

"Seven Up

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits.

My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

We were in a snow cave 91m below the summit when my climbing partner, Dougal Haston, began a conversation with Dave Clark, our Equipment Officer, about the relative merits of various sleeping bags. I thought this was strange, as only Dougal and I were present. Putting this down to oxygen deprivation, I then found myself talking to my feet. Already the cold was getting into the balls of my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite. It wasn’t survival that was worrying us so much as the quality of our survival.
Over the next two days I relived our time spent on the summit ridge. I realised that I couldn’t have been there with a better man than Dougal Hatton. He inspired great confidence in me and by now I was climbing with a calm presentiment mat somehow or other it was all going to work out. I realised I had to get a better rhythm going in order to reach the summit - which is what I did.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. In April 1976 Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days humping equipment and food up to the base. Only after the first day of climbing did we realise the enormity of our undertaking. On the lower face we followed a route put up in 1967, but at half height we pursued a new route, as planned, heading directly for the upper snow basin and the summit. We decided to climb
‘alpine style’, with our equipment and food on our backs. It would be the first time a major new route had been climbed here in such a way.
We climbed up the compressed snow of an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff and by the third day my sleeping bag was sodden. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering. Mt. McKinley, because the air pressure in the polar regions is lower, has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. It seemed to us that we were up at around 7,000m, instead of 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with the intention of climbing Mt. Kenya. It was though the unexpected offer of a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro that we came to climb Africa’s highest mountain.
On our approach we got ourselves lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes. Our situation became serious because water is scarce. On the second day we came across luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish which brought us to a rock pool. Never before had I been so pleased to find rubbish on a mountain.
We attempted a direct start to the breach wall, which is a 305m-high icicle. After a deluge of falling rock and ice we prudently retired and opted instead for the Umbwe route to gain the surrealistic summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a party up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the busy standard route, and suggested that we go with them.
After three days of sitting out bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier stretching up to the summit had been swept by vicious winds and glistened with pure ice. With a time limit to get back to Buenos Aires for our flight, we decided to miss out on the glacier. Instead we went across the north ridges towards the standard route and joined the large number of people wandering along the path. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit and just before it got dark we camped outside the refuge.
Back at base camp we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and felt, when they learnt that I had already climbed four, that I should do me same. This was the first time I had seriously thought about such goal-orientation — something I had previously tried to avoid.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality. Our team left Britain towards the end of November 1992 and travelled the thousands of kilometres to the South Pole. At this time of the year the sun is always well above the horizon, throughout the day and night, and when the wind stops blowing it is utterly quiet. As in other polar regions, in the keen, clean air, there is such an invigorating atmosphere that the spirits are raised just by being there. On December 7 we left camp and headed off towards the summit. Against expectations, with winds gusting at around 80 kms per hour and temperatures below minus 50°C, we all got to the top within 8 hours. Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

Our team assembled in St Petersburg during the early summer of 1994. On our arrival at the settlement of Terskol, beneath Elbrus, a commission was demanded from our guide for bringing foreigners into the valley, though this was later waived. 
After a few days’ acclimatising, the group set off up Elbrus by cableway to 3,900m. From there we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-
afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day descended this, fortunately extinct, volcano.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

On our expedition to Carstensz we hoped not only to establish a new route but to spend as much time as possible with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, regarded as sacred by the local tribespeople.
We had been warned that we might be taken hostage or even killed by bandits but, undeterred, we left our hut by mid-morning and walked down winding lanes towards the jungle. On May 12 we stayed climbing. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We were slower, since Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am. 
I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!",C1
"ECCENTRICS

An eccentric is by definition someone whose behaviour is abnormal, someone who refuses to conform to the accepted norms of his society. This, of course, immediately begs the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us, after all, have our quirks and oddities. It may be a passion for entering newspaper competitions, a compulsion for collecting beer mats, a tendency to write indignant letters to the press on every conceivable subject. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. Within most of us that urge is constantly in conflict with the contrary force. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity and in most of us it is conformity that is the more powerful. The desire to be accepted, loved, appreciated, to feel at one with our fellows, is stronger than the desire to stand out in the crowd, to be our own man, to do our own thing.
Notice, for example, how people who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour, tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems. The important word is 'common’. They look for other people with whom they can share what in the normal run of events is regarded by relatives, friends and neighbours as an oddity. A crowd, even a small crowd, is reassuring.
Probably all of us recognise a tension within ourselves between the two forces of individualism and conformity, for at the same time that most of us are going with the crowd, we tend to resent any suggestion that this is what we are doing. We feel a self-conscious need to assert our individuality as when the belligerent man at the bar informs his small audience, ""Well, I say what I think."" Or the wary stranger to whom we have just been introduced announces, ""You must take me as you find me. I don’t stand on ceremony.""
Any of us can, at any time, reverse this trend. We can stoke the boiler of individualism, assert our own personality. Many people have made it to the top in their chosen professions, basically by doing just that. One example is Bob Dylan, the American singer, who has gone on record as saying, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don’t back down and don’t give up - then you’re going to mystify a lot of folk. But that self-conscious assertion of individuality is not eccentricity, at least not in the early stages. When a pop singer deliberately wears bizarre clothes to gain publicity, or a society hostess makes outrageous comments about her guests in order to get herself noticed in the gossip columns, that is not eccentricity. However, if the pop star and the society hostess perpetuate such activities until they become a part of themselves, until they are no longer able to return to what most of us consider 'normal behaviour', then they certainly would qualify. For the most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics are not people who deliberately try to be odd, they simply are odd.
The true eccentric is not merely indifferent to public opinion, he is scarcely conscious at all. He simply does what he does, because of who he is. And this marks the eccentric as essentially different from, for example, enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists and recluses. These people are all very conscious of the world around them. Much of what they do, they do in reaction to the world in which they live. Some wish to make an impression on society, some wish to escape from society, but all are very much aware of society. The eccentric alone goes on his merry way regardless.",C1
"Explore Worldwide - small groups leave few footprints

Explore Worldwide is right in the forefront of adventure travel with trips designed for people who want to get more out of their holiday than just a beach. Our emphasis is on travel to new and unusual destinations, coupled with interesting and original itineraries. Our brochure contains over 100 original adventures - tours, treks, safaris and expeditions - in more than 60 countries around the world. Most trips last from 1-4 weeks.

Small Groups

Averaging 16 people. Small informal groups, expertly led. Giving you a real opportunity to discover more about the places we visit for yourself. More personal involvement brings you closer to the local scene and the local peoples. A stimulating experience for all travellers.

Different Modes of Travel

Many different kinds of transport are used. Often on the same trip. We travel by chartered coach or local bus, by train, expedition vehicle, minibus, boat, canoe, raft, camel, light plane etc. And often on foot. Each trip takes on the character of the local terrain.

Who Travels with Explore?

Interesting people with the resilience to tackle new situations and get the most out of an original adventure. Mainly from the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the States. All our trips are designed to be within the capabilities of almost anyone who enjoys good health, is reasonably fit, and above all adaptable. The majority are aged between 25 and 55. About half are couples. The rest are enterprising individuals travelling alone.

Activities and Interests

It’s not easy to describe Explore Worldwide. Each trip is completely unique. So we have divided our worldwide adventures into 8 different categories, describing some of the main activities and interests. Each category represents a special highlight that is an integral part of a particular tour, and of course trips have several different highlights. However, please bear in mind that many other factors contribute to the success of all our trips as a whole. Unique places, unusual encounters, strange customs, unpredictable events, personal involvement - all play their part in the full enjoyment of your holiday.

Cultural/Adventure

Almost all the trips in our brochure have a strong cultural feeling. But a certain number of tours have this as their primary emphasis, focusing closely on local cultures, ethnic peoples and classic sites. For example, anyone looking for destinations of outstanding cultural and historical interest should consider our trips in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala and Belize - to mention a few of the places featured in our programme! Short day walks of 2-4 hours to visit unusual or off-the-tourist-track sites are often an integral part of our trips.

Wildlife and Natural History

Our wildlife safaris visit many of the world's greatest game parks and offer a thrilling encounter with animals in their natural state. Choose from dozens of remarkable destinations. In Africa, for example, you often have the freedom to step outside your safari vehicle and tackle the wild terrain for yourself. You could track the rare silver-back mountain gorilla in Zaire, go bush walking with tribal guides in Uganda, climb Mount Kenya, ride a canoe on the Zambezi River or a traditional mokoro in the Okavango Delta. Most African safaris camp, and full camping equipment is provided. A few offer hotel and lodge accommodation throughout. Elsewhere, in Asia and South America, on trips which include game viewing - say, our tiger safari in India - we usually stay in hotels, resthouses and jungle lodges. In Darwin's famous Galapagos Islands we live aboard a small motor yacht.

Ethnic Encounters

A special highlight of an Explore Worldwide adventure is the opportunity it offers to meet ethnic or tribal peoples. These could be the ‘Blue Men’ or Tuareg of the Central Sahara, the Maya of Mexico, or the colourful Huli of Papua New Guinea. Some, like the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, are nomadic wanderers. Others, like the pygmies of the Ituri Forest, are hunter-gatherers; or dry rice farmers like the friendly hilltribe peoples of Northern Thailand. Many are often part of an ‘Old World' culture. Their societies are often under serious threat from unscrupulous exploiters. We travel in small groups only. Our aim is to help spread tolerance and understanding between different races and peoples, with the minimum of culture and environmental disturbance.

Easy/Moderate Hiking

Many trips include a few days’ easy walking through open countryside, based on rented or hotel accommodation; also village-to-village hiking which involves some trail walking with the prospect of overnighting along the way in private houses or basic village huts. You’ll find such trips in Spain’s Sierra Nevada, in Provence, Tuscany, Crete, Corsica, Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, Venezuela, and many other Explore Worldwide destinations. On long distance walks involving more than one day, all your main luggage is transported by a separate vehicle, or carried by porters or pack animals. You simply bring a daypack for your personal gear.

Major Treks

A limited number of major treks are offered for strong mountain walkers. These sometimes involve walking at elevations over 10,000 feet, with substantial altitude gains and losses during a single day. We may lodge with the local people or rough-camp in the world’s great mountain ranges like the Atlas, Kackar, Himalayas and Andes. Or we use a mixture of well-appointed camp-sites and alpine chalets in more sophisticated mountain areas such as the Alps. Such trips usually involve support vehicles, porterage or pack animals. We rarely backpack or carry heavy gear.

Wilderness Experience

Discovering one of the world’s remote wilderness areas is a thrilling and memorable experience - perhaps the ultimate travel adventure. Such places have a strong fascination for the intrepid traveller, holding out the prospect of exotic new horizons. We explore the haunting beauty of the Amazon Rainforest and experience the powerful mystique of the Sahara, Great Thor, Namib and Gobi Deserts. They offer a chance to participate in an adventure few people could ever dream of.

Sailtreks/Seatreks

These are among the most original and relaxing holidays in our brochure. We charter local boats and journey by traditional felucca sailboat through Upper Egypt; we utilise gulets (wooden motor yachts) in Turkey and island-to-island ferries in countries like Greece and Thailand. Our 2-masted schooner explores the islands of the Indonesian Archipelago, while a small motor yacht is chartered to cruise among the unique wildlife habitats of the Galapagos.

Raft and River Journeys

River journeys can last from a few hours to several days, and range from 2-person inflatables which participants paddle themselves (on the Dordogne River, for example) to all the fun, thrills and excitement of whitewater railing navigated by skilled oarsmen (such as on Peru's beautiful Urubamba River or the wild Trisuli River in Nepal). No previous experience is necessary and the appropriate safety skills are quickly learned. Our river trips in India, Africa and the Amazon offer us a unique insight into the fertile margins and exotic jungles.",C1
"So European anticlericalism was nothing new; it had been seething for centuries. What was new this time round was a by-product of the infant capitalism: wealth, urbanisation and education. Whilst still a minority, the literate laity were no longer confined to those in on the game, and were better educated than many priests who claimed to be the path to salvation (while taking their money in taxes). It rankled somewhat.
Criticism was stepped up, at home and abroad, by the Humanists. Led by Colet, More and Erasmus, they went back to basics, studying the Scriptures as they would any classical text. Yet they remained Catholics, attacking corruption but keen to reform from within, stressing toleration and man's inherent dignity. It was a depressed German cleric, Martin Luther, who lit the fuse for the first, European, Reformation. Provided no comfort by Catholic ritual and horrified by abuses in Italy, he concluded that salvation was a personal matter between God and man: traditional church ceremonial was irrelevant at best and at its worst - the sale of indulgences, for example - fraudulent. Nailing his 95 Theses to a church door in Wittenberg, Germany, he prompted massive theological debate and was condemned as a heretic and an outlaw.
It is one of history's great ironies that the man who publicly refuted him was none other than Henry VIII, rewarded with the title of Fidei Defensor - Defender of the Faith - in 1521. But it was too late. Luther's ideas were white hot and they spread fast. They soon reached England and were discussed by academics here, most notably the White Horse Group who were named after a Cambridge pub where scholars would meet, drink and put the world to rights.

Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself plus the inventor Tom Granger and the broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five currently available.
The 'dual alarm function' that is advertised with this model does not allow you, as I first supposed, to be woken by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends, but whose life is programmed to this extent?
Since this model costs more or less the same as the second model tested, the inclusion of a cassette player is quite a bargain - you can fall asleep to your own soothing tapes and wake up to a day without news. We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses and telephone. Anyway, I'm completely paranoid and always book a wake-up call in case the alarm doesn't go off.'
This model was voted best in the beauty stakes and overall winner. Paul Bridges declared himself 'in love with it', although the clock on the one he tested 'kept getting stuck at 16.00'. I was fascinated by the digital display, with its classy grey numbers on a gentle green background. The wide snooze bar means you can tap it on the edge with your eyes shut. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons, like pebbles on the beach, encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing when I finally looked at the SO-page instruction booklet.
The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out in order to use a hairdryer or the vacuum cleaner; this met with unanimous approval. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.
Tom Granger described this model with its extra built- in lamp as 'unbelievably tacky' in the way it's made. 'You have to wrench the funny light out of its socket to get it to work, which makes me wonder about the quality of the rest of it.' He complained that he had to read the instruction booklet twice before he could get it to work; the clock kept leaping from 12.00 to 02.00 so he had to go round again.
The light was certainly hard to position; you would never be able to read by it - it only shines on the clock, which is illuminated anyway. Paul Bridges said he was 'very tickled' by the lamp idea but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer is reminiscent of 'action stations' on a submarine and made me feel like hurling the whole thing across the bedroom. Interestingly, however, this model is the third most popular on the market.
Clearly aimed at young people, with its brightly coloured casing and matching bootlace strap, this one appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. 'I would choose this one because it doesn't disappear into the background like the others,' he said. In fact, the traditional design of the controls made it the only one we managed to set up without reading the instruction booklet. Too bad the alarm is allowed a hilarious 20- minute margin for error; the manual notes, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the pre-set time'. Paul Bridges scoffed at such a notion, adding that this model was 'terribly fiddly' and, indeed, 'completely useless'.
The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space', but also because it has old-fashioned dial tuning. 'It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning you're never really sure if you've pressed all the buttons in the right order so you can't have confidence that the thing will actually work.' He accepted, however, that manufacturers had been obliged to improve the quality of radios because of the advent of button-tuning. I thought the tuning rather crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model certainly works; it succeeded in getting me out of bed in just two beeps!

"Of course, the political and policy opinions and interests of all citizens are represented by groups to which we do not belong but with whom we share values or interests.  It may well be that (as the case of their attitude toward their own representative in comparison with their attitude toward everyone else’s representative) people think the group to which they belong is pursuing, not a “special” interest, but rather the public interest, while groups whose interest they do not share are self-serving. 
The concerns of the constituency, political parties and interest groups come to bear on the lawmaking process. So also do other factors, the most important of which are the merits of the particular case, that is, the substantive arguments for and against a particular bill, what individual representatives themselves believe, and their past records. 
Most of the discussion that takes place in the legislative process—whether in committee or on the floor or by lobbyists for various groups—relates to the merits of proposed legislation. Arguments, supported by evidence, are made in favor of a proposal, while other arguments, also supported by evidence, are made against a proposal. These opposing arguments are critical grist for the legislative mill. In the deliberation that takes place, arguments on one side or the other often are the decisive elements in how many legislators vote; and, if not decisive, they still play an influential role.",C1
"We changed lives for a day!

Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant and entertainment complex.

A. Amanda’s story

I’d never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I’d survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else!
I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first!
By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I’d remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated.
After a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say ‘Pardon?’, which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a ‘quiet' day!
I never realised how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shrinking violets, but in fact you definitely need to be quite bubbly, as well having the ability to keep a cool head and deal with what is known in the trade as a ‘high-volume experience' - in other words, lots of customers!
I’m really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets chaotically busy. I wasn’t too impressed with the pay either. Unfortunately, I must have been a lousy waitress because even the rich Americans didn’t tip me a bean!
I must admit I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing!

B. Cindy’s story

I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a ‘mum’ for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I’d been warned the girls were cheeky, but in my ignorance I thought I could handle it. Little did I know!
As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery I thought I’d have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house and do the washing.
At 1 pm I picked up Katie, whizzed around the supermarket and then took her home for lunch. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could! I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they’d soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!
After much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink, for heaven's sake? Of course, I realised it was just a ploy so they could come downstairs and watch television, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating deals with them.
I never realised how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sheer sense of responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.

Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school.

C. Rosemary’s story

On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was pure luxury! But I dithered for ages about how to look. I could hardly turn up in overalls and boots, could I?
Looking at a sea of faces — about 400 pupils — at assembly, I hoped I melted into the background and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm.
After that it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables in unison! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails.
By lunchtime I was exhausted and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. There’s so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials.
Alter lunch there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practise on me, which really showed up my rusty French.
Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.
The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I’ll stick to farming, anyway!

D. Hilary’s story

I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she manufactures ice-cream, yoghurt and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! At lunchtime it was time to inspect the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe which had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over they could die, so they have to he checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter!
Alter feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year!
I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't answer back! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year.
Farming seems romantic but the reality is very different. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.",C1
"In September 1533 Anne gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth I). Henry had grown tired of her, and after two further pregnancies ended in miscarriages, she was arrested in 1536 on trumped up charges of adultery and publicly beheaded at the Tower of London.
Henry's third marriage, this time to lady-in-waiting, Jane Seymour, finally produced the son he so desperately desired with the birth of Edward in 1537. Jane Seymour died after childbirth and Henry ordered that she be granted a queen's funeral.
In an attempt to establish ties with the German Protestant alliance, Thomas Cromwell arranged a marriage between the king and German princess Anne of Cleves. The marriage was a disaster and Henry divorced Anne a few months later. Henry blamed Cromwell for this mismatch and soon afterwards had him executed for treason.
The final years of his reign witnessed Henry VIII's physical decline and an increasing desire to appear all-powerful. Henry continued with fruitless and expensive campaigns against Scotland and France.
In 1540, the aging King married the teenage Catherine Howard. Their marriage was short lived. It was alleged that she had a previous relationship with Henry's courtier Francis Dereham and an affair with another courtier Thomas Culpeper. Catherine was executed for adultery and treason in 1542.
Henry's final marriage to Catherine Parr, who acted like a nurse, was more harmonious and she would go on to outlive him.
Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VI. He was buried next to Jane Seymour in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.",C1
"Young Masters

Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks again to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man’s game.

After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer’s victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. Mr Spassky is even older.
Chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. A new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer’s own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win.
In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense: a chess clock is used to ensure that each player completes the stipulated number of moves in the allotted time - failure to do so results in immediate loss of the game. But now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. It is significant that, of the world’s ten highest-ranked players, eight are under 30.
Nor is it only the way the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess is played off the board - and not just the battle for psychological advantage that Mr Fischer wages so well. Every professional must now take seriously his pre-match preparation, not least because the age of computer databases has had a profound impact on chess. A small portable computer can hold one million chess games, and give instant access to hundreds of games of a prospective opponent.
In one recent contest, each of the protagonists employed large teams of assistants to work round the clock searching for flaws in the other’s repertoire. The opening stages of a chess game are now analysed to near exhaustion. Simply being better prepared in chess opening can be the deciding factor in the game.
The chess world today boasts more first-rate players than at any stage in its history. Hundreds of grandmasters chase modest prize money the world over. Success demands physical as well as mental exertion. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension.
The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. When this occurs, each player has only seconds to make several moves or face instant forfeiture. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire. Such moments are not for reflective intellectuals. The game descends into a primeval struggle in which nerves, tenacity and an overwhelming will to win separate victor from vanquished.
At the top level of chess, the pain of losing is unbearable. Winning brings immense satisfaction and a chance to recover from the nerves and exhaustion. But one victory is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready for the struggle the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9-11 days, with play on every day, and there is an all-year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more exacting. The 1984 encounter between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be aborted after several months on the grounds of mutual exhaustion. Mr Karpov had shed around two stone (10kg) in weight.
Can Mr Fischer defy these odds? He once declared “All I want to do, ever, is play chess.""
This sentiment made his exodus from the chess world after 1972 seem even more inexplicable. But in some respects it was a fitting end to his story. It immortalised Bobby Fischer.
If he has come back for the money, he is onto a good thing. Whatever happens in his match with Mr Spassky, each will end up several million dollars richer. But if Mr Fischer has returned in the sincere belief that he can show he is still the best player in the world, the final result could be heartbreaking.",C1
"Sea, Ice & Rock

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy.
In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing.
It was the first time I’d been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin’s wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin’s skills at climbing.
The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.
He was used to using his arms, I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn’t too happy about it, but he lowered himself down quite safely. It was during that trip to Skye that Robin and I built the foundation of a very real friendship.
His proposal that we should combine our skills on a joint trip to Greenland was just an extension, on a rather grand scale, of our voyage to Skye. Robin impressed me immensely as a leader. Traditionally, the skipper makes all the decisions.
But Robin made a point of consulting everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel you were part of the decision-making process.
To be frank, I found the sailing trying and very boring. The moments of crisis which we had on the way back were easy to deal with: the adrenaline pumps and you get all worked up. The bit I found difficult was spending day after day in the middle of the sea.
I am a land-lover and not really a do-it-yourself type of person. Robin, in contrast, is a natural sailor and seemed to enjoy tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. I was aware that Robin didn’t really need me.
To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that very trying. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.
When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to ‘lead’ the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin’s life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral — Greenland’s highest mountain - would be.
Robin isn’t a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.
He just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we’d be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.
Yet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.
The previous night I’d almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn’t trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I’d jumped to the wrong conclusion.
While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn’t really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.",C1
"Fame and Fortune
Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some of the new British talent, from poet to pop star, heading for the top
A
Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is the author of three critically acclaimed plays. He is currently adapting his first play, Peaches, into a screenplay. 'It's low budget but we don't know how low,' he explains. 'It certainly won't be over £30 million, but then it could be 30 quid.'
Although obviously gifted, the most extraordinary thing about Nick is that before he wrote Peaches he had never been to or read a play in his life, 'When I wrote the play, I never even imagined it would get put on,' he says. 'It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the logistical problems. I knew absolutely nothing then.'
He left school at 16, only to return a year later, After A-levels, he enrolled at the Young People's Theatre, 'I realised I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard rather than read because of the rhythm and rhyme,' he says, 'Suddenly I was surrounded by like-minded people. It was the first time I'd been in an educational environment and actually enjoyed myself. It was very stimulating.’

Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has come a long way in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a television comedy series, and has just finished a punishing tour around the country with comedy star Steve Coogan,
He's always worked hard, Even as far back as Bristol, he was honing his art in comedy clubs. 'It was very theoretical at university,' remembers Simon, 'It made me realise I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I'd always been more interested in comedy, People think that comedy is the hardest job in the world and it really isn't. If you've got the courage and you've got good material, it's a wonderful thing to make people laugh.'
He has performed with the comic am Funny Business, but his relationship with Steve Coogan that has proved the most fruitful. ‘He saw my show and, as I was a huge fan of his, he could probably see me mimicking him,’ admits Simon. ‘It was comedy clubs. 'It was very theoretical at university.’ remembers Simon, 'It made me realise I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I'd always been more interested in comedy. People think that comedy is the hardest job in the world and it really isn't. If you've got the courage and you've got good material, it's a wonderful thing to make people laugh.'

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, came to the public's attention when he disco-danced into their living rooms as the lead in the series The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star, The critical reaction was extremely positive and his subsequent rise has been meteoric. 'It's been a really good showcase for me,' he says with a smile, 'I'm now in a situation where I can pick and choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted.' It is an unusually comfortable position to be in, especially when you consider that he has only just graduated, But glance at Ciaran's early career, and it's obvious such recognition was always on the cards.
Encouraged by his mother, he went from playing lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years, 'Basically I was using acting as an excuse not to do homework,' laughs Ciaran. 'But I suddenly decided I wanted to make a go of it because I had a knack for it, and a passion for it.’
Now he is more or less sitting back and waiting for the plaudits to roll in - but ask him what he thinks of the fame game and he suddenly becomes pensive, 'When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and the interviews but you soon realise it's not what you're acting for. It's not about that, It's about getting respect for doing good work.’

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer in the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three- album deal with Domino Records, Neil and the other half of Matrix, Rick Brown, are already tipped to be huge when their single, Chimera, is released shortly, 'The record company's idea of good sales is very different to mine,' he says, 'They're talking smash hit, but I've no idea, For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy.'
Unlike so many new pop sensations, Neil has actually worked very hard for his success, He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music business ever since, 'It's funny how things happen,' he says, 'I'd been slogging away doing student gigs for eight years and I was starting to get a bit jaded, I was just about to give up when this happened.' By 'this' he means meeting Rick Brown, who already had contacts at Domino, and forming Matrix, It couldn't have happened at a better time, 'There were times when I was thoroughly depressed - and I've been in some atrocious bands, But hopefully it will all have been worth it.’

Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more prizes, awards and academic honours than anyone twice his age, He is already well known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving several readings a week for the past six years, Now his first novel, Hidden, will be published in March, 'It's a story of obsessive love. It was a very strong idea that I couldn't do as a poem.'
Stephen was a huge fan of creative writing at school, but became disenchanted with education later on, 'I decided not to go to university but it wasn't until I became very bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre that I decided I should.’ After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992, 'I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer - they always thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child.’ With his poetry receiving such critical acclaim, his move into novels is indeed brave. 'There's a framework with my poetry and less scope for me to do something hideously wrong,’ he explains. 'Because a novel can be any length of words, there are more words that could be bad words. My main ambition is not to get into a pattern where I'm just churning stuff out without worrying about the quality.’

"It's one of those things everybody's heard of but nobody really quite understands. The culmination of centuries of Catholic corruption, or a bit of a fluke? The consequence of a European power vacuum, or grand theological debate? A reasonable quest for a son and heir, or simply a result of Henry VIII's lustful nature?
Well, it is down to all of those, really. If it were as simple as any one of these options, there would be little mystery. They were all necessary for the English Reformation, but not one by itself was sufficient to bring about the chain of events that would eventually alter England and Englishness forever. So much in history is a bastard child of both long-standing, simmering emotion and the opportunistic seizing of a moment. By its nature unexpected, it is also unpredictable, and shaped as much by environment and chance as by its progenitors. The Reformation was no different.
The story really begins over a hundred years earlier, when the Papacy began to reap the effects of centuries of compromise. The Great Schism saw two, even three individuals claiming to be the Pope, and the Council of Constance in the early fifteenth century saw a power struggle between Bishops and Pope. Combined, they hindered Papal government and harmed the reputation of the Church in the eyes of the laity. They led early sixteenth century popes to resist reform and bolster their own position by using their spiritual power, along with war and diplomacy, to become territorial princes in Italy, building their bank accounts on the way.",C1
"Now stripped of its more obnoxious clauses, and above all without the insistence on a baronial committee of 25, the charter was used to recover the allegiance of those increasingly convinced that King Louis would be little better than King John. When the tide of political fortune swung decisively in the boy king’s favour, following defeats for Louis and his supporters in battle at Lincoln, Henry III once again reissued the charter, in November 1217. On this occasion, it was accompanied by a second charter covering those parts of England set aside as ‘forest’ (in theory reserved for the King’s hunting, beyond the usual rule of law). It was the contrast between the great charter of liberties and the smaller charter governing the forests that gave rise, from 1217 onwards, to the name ‘Magna Carta’ (the 'Big' or 'Great' Charter) applied to the larger of these two documents.
In 1225, at his coming of age, to buy further support and in return for taxation to defend his remaining lands in France, Henry III reissued Magna Carta. It was this charter of 1225 that henceforth became the definitive form, reissued or confirmed on numerous occasions throughout the 13th century. Like the 1216 and 1217 charters, the 1225 Magna Carta cut away nearly half of the text originally agreed at Runnymede. Out went the clauses regulating Jewish debt, taxation, the farms paid by sheriffs for their counties, the insistence that sheriffs and other officers know the laws of England, that the king expel his alien constables, that all hostages be released, and that settlements be devised with both the Welsh and the Scots. Above all, out went all mention of the baronial committee of 25 set above the king to impose justice where the king acted beyond the law.",C1
"From here to paternity

A. The theatre director

Because of my bizarre personal life, which I cannot be proud of, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about.
I’m terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become a friend rather than a father.
I don’t believe in physical violence. I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don’t condone it. I’m sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I’m here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me. As soon as you start chasing them to ask why they have not been in touch, you impose this terrible burden of guilt. My parents did it to me and I would never do it to my children.

B. The advertising executive 

I was young when they were born, only around 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite irksome. It aged me quickly, but at the same time it kept me young, which is something I have always valued. 
As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I could have drifted away from: music, youth culture, clothes. In a funny way that has been invaluable as far as running the agency has been concerned. I have never felt out of touch. 
Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I’m sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.
They get on well with a lot of our friends and they come to parties with us and advertising awards ceremonies without feeling intimidated. I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting.

C. The politician

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected onto the Greater London Council, and the others followed in quite quick succession. My wife and I vowed that we would carve out time for them but since I have become more and more politically active, time has become a real problem. 
I make it a condition that I will only accept weekend meetings and public appearances where there are facilities for one or more of the kids to come with me. If I did not they would just get squeezed out. This way they have a sense of what I do when I am not with them and there is no feeling of Daddy disappearing.
I’ve noticed more and more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more conscious of the need to involve our children in our lives.

D. The writer

My first marriage broke up when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I was forced to examine the whole area of fatherhood more closely than I might otherwise have done. I made enormous efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even experimented with living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wished, but I think Kate and Bonnie would say now that they found that quite confusing.
Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. It is true I was around a lot, but, like a lot of Seventies parents, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining only the other day that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more systems, more order. Instead I took this very loose approach. I regret that now.
I still worry about my elder daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way your kids never leave you.

E. The TV presenter

I was ready for kids. I'd hit 30, met my wife, we had a lovely house, so we thought, “Why carry on going to the shops every Saturday spending our money on new sofas, when we could have a kid instead?”
Having my daughter Betty has forced me to come to terms with who I am and what I am. You feel you are doing something very special when you conceive a child, and you are. But you are also becoming just one more parent in a great long line of parents. It’s a great leveller.
I do resent it occasionally but if ever there is a moment of irritation, it is dispelled by just one look at her. A baby’s smile is the greatest self-preservation mechanism in the world. It can melt a grown man.",C1

"This is my homestay family. Jordi is 19. He studies English and he teaches me Spanish. Cesc is 13 - my age - and I go to his school. 
School is different from England. We get up early - at seven o'clock and the first lesson is at eight. School finishes at two o'clock - no lessons in the afternoon! 
My classroom is fantastic. I've got a new computer and the teacher uses a whiteboard on the wall. I sit between Cesc and a girl, Mireia - she's very pretty! We go home at two o'clock and we have a big lunch. 
In England, I have lunch at school. The family's house is next to the beach. We go swimming every day. In the evening, Cesc and I do our homework. 
Jordi helps me with my Spanish and he goes out with his friends. We have dinner at 9.30. In England, I go to bed at nine but in Spain bedtime is very late - eleven o'clock (don't read this, Mum!).

"A mountain range is a series of mountains that are connected together generally to form a long line of mountains. Large mountain ranges may be made up of smaller mountain ranges called subranges. 

For example, the Smokey Mountain Range is part of the Appalachian Mountain Range. It is a subrange of the Appalachians. 

The tallest mountain range in the world is the Himalayas and the longest is the Andes. 

The Himalayas stretch 1,491 miles through much of central Asia. They travel from Afghanistan and Pakistan through India, Nepal, and China all the way to Bhutan. The Himalayas also include the formidable Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges. The Himalayas are most famous for their tall peaks. The majority of the worlds tallest mountains are in the Himalayas including the two tallest mountains: Mount Everest at 29,035 feet and K2 at 28,251 feet. The Himalayas have played an important role in the history of Asia. The mountains in Tibet and the high peaks are considered sacred in many religions including Buddhism and Hinduism. 

At around 4,300 miles long, the Andes Mountains make up the world's longest mountain range. The Andes stretch north to south through much of South America including such countries as Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. The highest peak in the Andes is Mount Aconcagua which rises to 22,841 feet. Machu Picchu located high in the Andes. The Andes played a vital role in the history of South America. The Inca built their famous ancient city, Machu Picchu high in the Andes.

"The next day Rachel was sitting in her office. She was thinking about the woman at the party. She looked through some books on palmistry. She had a lot of books. She couldn't find any information about life lines before the two world wars. Maybe the woman was right. She stood up, and went to the door.
'Mark,' she called, 'Mark, can you come into my office for a minute?'
Mark was one of the computer programmers. He worked with Mervyn on the palmistry program. He came in, and sat down. Rachel told him about the woman at the party.
'Mark,' she said, 'can we do a statistical analysis of all the palmistry photographs?'
Mark looked surprised, 'Yes,' he said, 'we can do that. It's easy. But why? What are you looking for?'
'I'm not sure,' said Rachel. 'I've got an idea. Maybe it's a silly idea, but I want to compare all the photographs. Maybe we can find something in all of them. Something about the future.'
'You mean ... you mean a lot of short life lines?'
'I hope not,' said Rachel. 'But it's interesting, isn't it? I want you to compare different towns and cities. Compare them with each other, and compare them with the country areas. I want statistics for different areas of the country. We've got all this information in the computer. Why don't we use it? You can do it, can't you?'

'You've never done much walking, have you? I don't think you could walk the five miles to our cottage!'
'But I'd like to meet your family,' Mary said.
Martha looked at the little girl for a moment. She remembered how disagreeable Mary had been when she first arrived. But now, Mary looked interested and friendly.
'I'll ask Mother,' said Martha. 'She can always think of a good plan. She's sensible and hardworking and kind - I know you'll like her.'

'Well, I must go now. It's my day off, so I'm going home to help Mother with the housework. Goodbye, miss. See you tomorrow.'

When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run.
I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but also use this as an excuse for not providing separate changing facilities.
I put up posters and 40 women, young and old, fit and unfit, joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river.
At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general.
I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves.",B1

"Winter Driving

Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road.
Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Uneven movements can make a car suddenly very difficult to control. So every time you either turn the wheel, touch the brakes or increase your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Imagine you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it.
Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will avoid trouble.",B1
"On October 27th, the Terra Nova arrived in Wellington, New Zealand. When Scott came off the ship, a newspaper man walked up to him.
'Captain Scott! Captain Scott! Can I talk to you, please!' he said.

'Are you going to win?' the man asked. 'Win?' Scott asked. 'Win what?'
'Win the race to the South Pole, of course,' the newspaper man said. 'It's a race between you and Amundsen, now. Look at this!' He gave a newspaper to Scott. Scott looked at it. It said:
Norwegian races Scott to South Pole
'We're going to win!' says Amundsen
Scott's face went white. 'Give me that!' he said. He took the newspaper and read it carefully. The newspaper man watched him, and waited. 'Well, Captain Scott,' he said at last. 'Who's going to win this race? Tell me that!'
Scott looked at him angrily. 'This is stupid!' he said. 'It's not a race! I came here to learn about the Antarctic - I'm not interested in Amundsen, or in races!' Then he walked back onto his ship, with the newspaper in his hand.
Later that day, he talked to his men. He gave them the newspaper, and laughed.
'It doesn't matter,' he said. 'We're in front of Amundsen, and we have more men, and more money. He has only eight men, and a lot of dogs. I know about dogs - they don't work in the Antarctic. We have sixteen men and the new motor sledges - they are much better. And tomorrow the ponies are coming. We need ponies, motor sledges, and good strong British men - that's all.

"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival, an annual nine-day event.
The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. There were about a dozen hot-air balloons and they took off from the car park in the middle of Albuquerque. From these small beginnings, the festival has grown steadily. This year at least a thousand balloons from over one third of the countries of the world are expected at its current out-of-town site.
What to see
The pilots are in radio contact with each other and all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. These are known as 'balloon glows' and are an opportunity to take fantastic photographs. However, you must arrive just after night has fallen or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky.
During the day, you can walk around among the balloons and chat to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colours, some in the shapes of animals or cartoon characters and, of course, well-known products such as varieties of soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it.
In the afternoon, why not take to the sky yourself by arranging a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering balloon rides? Another possibility is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest such ride anywhere, and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are plenty of other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and firework displays on the opening evening and the last three evenings of the festival.
The Albuquerque Box
This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds, and at the same time create gentler currents of wind at different heights. This means that by rising or descending, skilful pilots can control the direction of their balloons.
Practical advice
Buy your tickets in advance (they are available on line) and save yourself a long wait to get into the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. At night and in the early morning it can be quite cool, but during the day sunglasses and suncream are essential. Bring a flashlight for night-time events and, of course, bring your camera. If you're not a digital photographer, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night-time pictures.",B1
"Lakes are large bodies of water that are surrounded by land and are not part of an ocean. Lakes are relatively still bodies of water when compared to a river where the water flows. They can contain either salt or fresh water and are larger than ponds. 

Below are descriptions of some of the larger and more important lakes in the world: 

The Caspian Sea is the largest lake by surface area in the world. It is so large that it is sometimes classified as a minor ocean or as the world's only sea that doesn't connect to an ocean. There are five different countries that have coast lines on the Caspian Sea including Russia, Iran, Kasakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. Over 130 rivers flow into the Caspian Sea with the largest being the Volga River. 

The Great Lakes are located in North America on the border between Canada and the United States. They include five lakes: Michigan, Huran, Erie, Ontario, and Superior. Together they make up the largest freshwater lakes on earth. Twenty-one percent of the worlds surface fresh water is held by the Great Lakes. The surface of Lake Ontario is quite a bit lower in elevation than the rest of the Great Lakes. The elevation difference is mostly made at Niagara Falls where the water level drops from 569 feet in Lake Erie to 243 feet at Lake Ontario.

Lake Baikal at 5314 feet deep is the deepest lake in the world. It's located in southern Russia. It's also the world's largest lake by volume and the second longest lake in the world.

Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland, and because of its northerly location, the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis.

It was February, my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred metres up - probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up.
We were carrying tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots -you'd have trouble on Ben Nevis without them because you get snow so hard it's like walking on ice. Even though some of the group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, including lights for attracting attention, hard hats and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when we set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.
The track soon climbed and my legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, I had to rest more frequently. The others sometimes stopped for a break to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them they set off again. I promised myself that in future I would always train properly before a climb.
After 200 metre<;,we reached the beginning of Tower Ridge, the route that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It's only a metre and a half wide and the mountain drops away hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to keep calm and concentrate on every step as we moved slowly along it.
After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. However, we weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down.
On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly a wrong turn could lead to slopes too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top.",B1
"Little Chefs

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.'
Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.'",B1
"The next morning we read in the newspaper that John Openshaw was dead. A policeman found him in the river near Waterloo station. The police said it was an accident, but Holmes was very angry about it.
'He came to me for help and those men murdered him! I'm going to find them, if it's the last thing I do!' he said to me, and he hurried out of the house.
In the evening, when he came back to Baker Street, he was tired, but pleased. 'Watson!' he said, 'I know the names of Openshaw's enemies! And now I'm going to send them a surprise! This will frighten them!' He took five pips from an orange and put them in an envelope. On it he wrote: 'S.H. for J.C.'
'I'm sending the pips, not from the K.K.K., but from me, Sherlock Holmes, to Captain James Calhoun. His ship is called the Star. He and his men are sailing back to Georgia, USA, now.'
'How did you find him, Holmes?' I asked.
'Ship's papers,' he said. 'I've looked at hundreds of them today. Only one ship, the Star, was in the three ports at the right times, and this morning the Star left London to sail back to Georgia. I found out that the captain and two of his men, all Americans, weren't on the ship last night, so I'm sure they killed poor John Openshaw. When they arrive in America, they'll get the pips and then the police will catch them!'

"Dan walked along the corridor. There were some stairs at the end. He ran up the stairs. There was a door at the top. He pushed the door, and it opened. It wasn't locked! He went through the door, and he was on the roof.
He looked around. A large helicopter was standing on the roof. Dan stopped and looked at it for a moment. The helicopter was a Westing Type 23. He thought for a moment. The Westing Type 23 had twenty seats, two engines and it could fly at 300 kilometres an hour. But how did he know that? He tried to remember. Of course! He used to work at a helicopter factory. He used to make Westing helicopters. He used to work! But when was that? And where? Why did he stop working? And why did he come to Sunnyvista City? Dan walked across the roof. It was very wide. He walked to the side and looked over the wall at Sunnyvista City. Then he walked across to the other side and looked over that wall. He shook his head. There was another valley with more buildings. It looked exactly the same as Sunnyvista City. There was a door on the other side with a notice on it, 'Sortie'. He tried to think. 'Sortie', it was French. It meant 'exit'. But when did he learn French? He turned and ran over to the helicopter. The door was open. There were a lot of boxes inside. They were empty.
Dan climbed in, and hid behind the boxes. There was writing on the boxes. One said 'Sunnyvista City', another said 'Club du Soleil', a third said 'Playa del Sol'.

"Mr Valdemar was dead. I was sure of this. His arms and legs were cold. He was not breathing and his heart was not beating. So I was very surprised when he spoke to me. But his voice did not come from his mouth. It came from somewhere deep in his body.
""I've been sleeping, but now I'm dead,"" said Mr Valdemar.
After this, Mr Valdemar did not change. He was dead, but he was not dead. The nurse closed Mr Valdemar's mouth.
Maybe he was not dead! I spoke to him again. Maybe he tried to reply, but he could not.
The next morning Mr Valdemar's doctor returned. The doctor looked at Mr Valdemar but he did not sign a death certificate.
""I can't sign the official document,"" he said. ""I don't think that the patient is dead. You mustn't put him in a coffin. You mustn't bury him in a tomb. Wait another day.""
The doctor came back the next day, and the day after that. Mr Valdemar lay on the bed. His body did not move. He did not breathe. He did not speak. He lay like a dead man. It was the sleep of death. But his body did not change. Mr Valdemar was not dead.
""Tell me when his body changes,"" said the doctor. ""Soon his skin and flesh will become black and bad. Then you'll know chat Mr Valdemar is dead. I will sign a death certificate when you tell me this.""
How long did we wait by Mr Valdemar's body? You will not believe me! Mr Valdemar lay on the bed for seven months! His body never became black and bad. It never changed.

"Holmes and I were surprised. This was a very strange story. I did not believe that Sir Charles Baskerville had been killed by a gigantic black dog. But I wanted to know the truth.
'Who else saw these footprints?' asked Sherlock Holmes. His bright eyes shone and he leant forward in his chair.
'No one else saw the footprints,' answered Dr Mortimer. 'There was a lot of rain in the night. By morning, the footprints had been washed away.'
'How large were the footprints? Were they larger than the footprints of a sheepdog?'
'Yes, Mr Holmes, much larger. They were not the prints of an ordinary dog.'
'Also, you say that Sir Charles ran away from this dog? How do you know?' asked Holmes.
'The ground was soft,' answered Dr Mortimer. 'I saw Sir Charles' footprints outside Baskerville Hall. His footprints were close together as he walked along a path at the edge of the moor. Then he stopped and waited by a wooden gate. After that his footprints changed - they became wide apart and deep. I am sure he began to run. He ran towards the house. I believe that something came from the moor. I believe he saw the Hound of the Baskervilles.'
'Yes, yes,' said Holmes, 'but how do you know that Sir Charles waited by this wooden gate?'
'Because he smoked a cigar,' said Dr Mortimer. 'I saw the white cigar ash on the ground.'
'Good,' said Holmes, 'good - you are a detective.'
'Thank you,' said Dr Mortimer, with a smile.

"Atlantic College

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually, it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom, as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend the morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers.
One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of £20,000 over two years, grants are available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of those can only attend because they receive government help.
""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like. During the summer holidays my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister.""
To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.

"Dave Slatin kept his promises. Things at the shop were good and cheap.
'How does he do it?' asked Mrs Harrison. 'Its winter, but he's selling lots of fruit and vegetables. And they're cheap. I never go to Lidney now.'
The other villagers agreed. The Corner Shop was a success and Dave seemed happy. He paid Anna good wages. Sometimes her friend, Peter, helped at the shop and Dave gave him money too.
Dave advertised in newspapers and the village products sold well. People from Lidney came to The Corner Shop. There were lots of visitors and Woodend became more interesting. The villagers were surprised, but pleased. They were making a lot of money.
Dave lived alone, in a flat above the shop. He was very popular in the village, but no one ever went to his flat. No one ever saw inside it.
At the bottom of the stairs there were two doors. One led into the stockroom. The other door had a notice on it: SPECIAL ORDERS ONLY: KEEP OUT
The door was always locked. Anna never went into the Special Orders room.
'Why do you lock that room, Dave?' Anna asked one day, 'What's in there?'
'It's for special orders,' he replied. 'Big orders.'
'But you won't get any big orders in Woodend,' said Anna.
Dave said nothing. He did not want to talk about that room.
For three months, everything was normal.
Then, one day in April, an unusual customer came into the shop. The new customer was a very beautiful woman. She was wearing expensive clothes and arrived in a large car.
'Is this The Corner Shop?' the woman asked. She looked round and seemed a little surprised.
'Yes,' replied Anna. This is The Corner Shop. It's the only shop in the village.'

"Modern graffiti began in big cities in the United States in the 1970s. In New York, young people wrote their names, or 'tags', in pen on walls around the city.

One of the first 'taggers' was a teenager called Demetrius. His tag was TAKI 183. He wrote his tag on walls and in stations in New York. Other teenagers saw Demetrius's tag and started writing their tags too. Soon, there were tags on walls, buses and trains all over New York.

Then, some teenagers started writing their tags with aerosol paint. Their tags were bigger and more colourful. Aerosol paint graffiti became very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. It appeared on trains, buses and walls around the world.

In the 1990s and 2000s, a lot of graffiti artists started painting pictures. Some artists' pictures were about politics. Other artists wanted to make cities beautiful and painted big, colourful pictures on city walls.
In some countries, writing or painting on walls is a crime. Sometimes, graffiti artists have problems with the police. In other countries, artists can draw and paint in certain places. For example, in Taiwan, there are 'graffiti zones' where artists can paint on walls. In São Paulo in Brazil, street artists can paint pictures on walls and houses. Their pictures are colourful and beautiful. Some tourists visit São Paulo just to see the street art!
In Bristol in the UK, there is a street art festival in August every year. Artists paint all the buildings in a street. Lots of people come to watch the artists and take photos. You can see exhibitions of street art in some galleries too. There have been exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles.

New picture
The Gallery now has a fine still life by the Dutch 18th century painter Jan van Os. This large picture (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colours on wood. It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery. The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is not unusual for a picture like this to be dated in two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to bloom in their different seasons in order to paint them. This picture was generously given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.
Special exhibition
The exhibition 'Painting in Spain during the late 18th century' opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period. Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition. These three artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez, and by two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

"Watering the Desert
 It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh, Morocco. It doesn’t happen frequently and when it does, the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods, which turn the streets into rivers. But, as many winters have remained dry in recent times, when the rain does come, it is welcomed by the local people. 
Marrakesh’s parks and gardens exist, not because of the rain, but thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. Basically dry places, which receive their water in this way, are known as oases. 
Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here every available piece of land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.

"Jack ran down one street and up the next. He turned left. He turned right. He ran and ran. Then he listened. He couldn't hear the sailors. He was free! But he had the chains on his hands.
He saw a store and opened the doors. Then he went in, very carefully. It was dark, but he could see some swords and knives.
""Ah, a blacksmith's store,"" he thought. ""I can use one of those knives.""
He took one and started to cut the chains. It was hard work, and it hurt his hands. But after a minute or two the chains fell to the floor.
Suddenly, Jack heard a sound behind him. It was Will Turner.
""What are you doing here?"" asked Will. He looked at Jack. ""Oh, you're the pirate. People are looking for you.""
He took a sword.
""Is that a good idea?"" asked Jack.
Will didn't speak. He put up his sword and looked at Jack.
They fought. Jack was quick, but Will was quick, too.
""You can use a sword!"" said Jack.
He turned and ran to the door. But Will was too quick for him. He threw his sword at the door. It went over Jack's head. Jack tried to pull it out, but he couldn't. And now he couldn't open the door.
He turned to Will and smiled.
""That was good,"" he said. He looked at the other door to the store. ""But you're between me and that door. And now you have no sword!""
Will took another sword and they fought again.
""Do you make these swords?"" Jack asked.

The bedrooms are around -4° C, but fortunately guests are provided with special sleeping bags that will keep them warm in the coldest of temperatures. Suitable outdoor clothes can be supplied too, if needed. 
The hotel is never more than six months old because it melts in summer, and each winter it is rebuilt. Creating the hotel takes 10,000 tonnes of ice, plus 30,000 tonnes of snow.

"The great thing about “The House On Mango Street” is that it’s an interesting read. It’s written from the point of view of the writer.

There are a few challenging words and a little bit of descriptive language, but you can usually understand them with the context. Another great thing about this is book is that it gives you a deep understanding of a different culture.

"Monsieur Firmin was right. All Paris talked about the new Margarita in Faust, the girl with the beautiful voice, the girl with the voice of an angel. People loved her. They laughed and cried and called for more. Daae was wonderful, the best singer in the world!
Behind the stage Meg Giry looked at Annie Sorelli. 'Christine Daae never sang like that before,' she said to Annie. 'Why was she so good tonight?'
'Perhaps she's got a new music teacher,' Annie said.
The noise in the Opera House went on for a long time. In Box 14, Philippe, the Comte de Chagny, turned to his younger brother and smiled.
'Well, Raoul, what did you think of Daae tonight?'
Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, was twenty-one years old. He had blue eyes and black hair, and a wonderful smile. The Chagny family was old and rich, and many girls in Paris were in love with the young Vicomte. But Raoul was not interested in them.
He smiled back at his brother. 'What can I say? Christine is an angel, that's all. I'm going to her dressing-room to see her tonight.'
Philippe laughed. He was twenty years older than Raoul, and was more like a father than a brother.
'Ah, I understand,' he said. 'You are in love! But this is your first night in Paris, your first visit to the opera. How do you know Christine Daae?'
'You remember four years ago, when I was on holiday by the sea, in Brittany?' Raoul said. 'Well, I met Christine there. I was in love with her then, and I'm still in love with her today!'

"Christmas is the biggest festival in the English year. Once the festival lasted two days; today it seems to last almost two months. Christmas Day, December 25th, is the day when most people in Britain sit down to a special meal of roast turkey and Christmas pudding; but Christmas Day is just the high point of the ""Christmas period"".
    In the weeks before Christmas, life is very busy. There are parties; there are trips to the cinema or the pantomime; and of course there's all the shopping.
    On Christmas day, Britain closes! For most people, Christmas is a time to relax at last after many long and busy weeks. The presents have been bought and sent, dozens of cards have been sent and received, the food is waiting to be eaten. For two days at least (if not three or four, depending on the year), the shops will be shut, and the postman will not deliver any letters. For a day or two, even the trains stop running. 
    Nowadays, Britain's Christmas shopping season lasts almost four months! The first Christmas catalogues come through letter-boxes at the start of September!
    Lots of busy people like shopping online, because it is easy. All they have to do is choose from the pages of a colourful catalogue, or use the Internet. A few days later, goods are delivered to the door... or at least one hopes they are. Some Internet shops work 24/24 in the weeks before Christmas, to make sure that everyone gets their presents on time.

'I remember it was a warm morning in June. When I went on board I told the steward I the number of my cabin - 105. He nearly dropped my suitcase.
'Well, God help you!' he said quietly.
'I thought he might be drunk, but I said nothing and followed him. Cabin 105 was a large room with two berths with curtains around them. Mine was the lower one. That morning the cabin seemed empty and depressing, and I didn't like it.
'I gave the steward some money and he thanked me. 'I'll try to make you comfortable,' he said, and then added quietly, 'If that's possible in this cabin.'
'I was surprised, but again I thought he was drunk. I was wrong.
'Our voyage began. On the first day everything was normal. That night I was tired and went to my cabin early. I noticed another suitcase by the door and a walking stick and an umbrella in the berth above mine. I wasn't happy because I had wanted to be on my own.

"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London intending to study law, but went to art school instead. There he found the traditional drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting.
In his late twenties he was given money by the Italian government to study art, and became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and wanted to put this light into his paintings.
This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark, but he insists he's never sure what the results will be. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.'
Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not do the painting afterwards.
Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.'
Since moving to London years ago, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters.

"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST 

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, in Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. 
Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University, and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual, as most women then had few opportunities to study. 
After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria where she began teaching mathematics. She soon became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. 
We have no copies of her books, but we know that she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work. 
At the time many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone connected with it was in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.

"Being an older student

At 32, I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays.
I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary, although I was earning a reasonable amount of money, I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in the job. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who looked happy, carefree and full of hope, and part of something that I wanted to explore further.
However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. They are always mistaking me for a lecturer and asking me questions I can't answer. I also feel separated from the lecturers because, although we are the same age, I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job, which is really important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. Then there are the normal student benefits of long holidays and theatre and cinema discounts. I often have doubts about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this late date has been a wise choice.",B1
"Humphrey Partridge stood by the open door of the second bedroom. There was a smile on his lips as he looked at the empty bed.
'It's all right, Mother. Just the post,' Humphrey Partridge called from the bottom of the stairs, as he opened the door to the village postman.
'There's a package for you, Mr Partridge,' said Reg Carter, putting his hand on the door. 'From a garden centre, it says on it. Roses, I think.'
'Yes,' said Partridge, trying to close the door.
'It's the right time of year for planting roses, is it? November?'
'Yes.'
'How's your mother?' Reg went on. He was in no hurry to leave.
'Not so bad.'
'She never seems to get any letters, does she?'
'No. Well, when you reach that age, most of your friends are dead.'
'How old is she now?'
'She was eighty-six last July.'
'That's a good age. She doesn't go out much, does she?'
'No, not at all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to leave to catch my train to work.'
Partridge closed the door and called up the stairs, 'Goodbye, Mother. I'm off to work.'
On his way to the station he stopped at the village shop to get his newspaper.
'Good morning,' said Mr Denton, the shopkeeper. 'How's the old lady?'
'Oh, not too bad, thank you - for her age, that is.'
'Oh, Mr Partridge,' said Mrs Denton, 'there's going to be a meeting in the village hall on Sunday, about-'
'I'm sorry, Mrs Denton, I don't like to leave my mother at weekends. I'm at work all week, you see.' He hurried away.

"There was a great famine in Rome. The summer had been very dry and the
corn crop had failed. There was no bread in the city. The people were
starving.

One day, to the great joy of all, some ships arrived from another
country. These ships were loaded with corn. Here was food enough for
all.

The rulers of the city met to decide what should be done with the corn.

""Divide it among the poor people who need it so badly,"" said some.
""Let it be a free gift to them from the city.""

But one of the rulers was not willing to do this. His name was
Coriolanus, and he was very rich.

""These people are poor because they have been too lazy to work,"" he
said. ""They do not deserve any gifts from the city. Let those who wish
any corn bring money and buy it.""

When the people heard about this speech of the rich man, Coriolanus,
they were very angry.

""He is no true Roman,"" said some.

""He is selfish and unjust,"" said others.

""He is an enemy to the poor. Kill him! kill him!"" cried the mob. They
did not kill him, but they drove him out of the city and bade him never
return.

Coriolanus made his way to the city of Antium, which was not far from Rome. The people of Antium were enemies of the Romans and had often been at war with them. So they welcomed Coriolanus very kindly and made him the general of their army.

Coriolanus began at once to make ready for war against Rome. He
persuaded other towns near Antium to send their soldiers to help him.

"The weeks passed and the corn grew high. Skip tried to think of ways to annoy Frosby, to force him to rent part of the river to him.
But he forgot about Frosby when Maggie came home for the summer holidays.
Skip met her at the airport in New York, and they drove up to Maine. Skip thought she looked taller; she was certainly more beautiful!
'I've got a surprise for you at home,' Skip said.
'Oh - a horse, perhaps?'
Skip had forgotten she was learning to ride. 'No, not a horse.' The surprise was a red Toyota. He had remembered, at least, that Maggie's school had taught her to drive. She was very excited, and threw her arms round Skips neck. 'Oh, Father, you're so sweet! And you're looking very well!'
Skip and Maggie went for a drive in the new car the next morning. In the afternoon Maggie asked her father if she could go fishing in the stream. He had to tell her that she couldn't, and he explained the reason.
'Well, never mind, there are a lot of other things to do.' Maggie enjoyed going for walks, reading and doing little jobs in the house.
Skip was surprised one evening when Maggie arrived home in her Toyota carrying three fish. He was afraid she had been fishing in the stream, against his instructions.
'Where did you get those?'
'I met the boy who lives there. We were both buying petrol, and he introduced himself- he said he'd seen my photograph in your house. Then we had coffee together-'
'The Frosby boy?'

"Sherlock Holmes did not like aimless physical exercise, but one spring day I persuaded him to go for a walk with me in the park. We walked for two hours, and it was almost five when we returned to Baker Street.
'I beg your pardon, sir,' said our page-boy, as we entered, 'there was a man waiting for you. He was a very restless gentleman. He walked all around the room saying, ""Isn't Mr Holmes going to return?"" Finally he left.'
'You see,' Holmes said to me, 'I needed a case, and now I have lost this one because we went for a walk in the park.'
'Hullo! That's not your pipe on the table. Well, that man must have a very big problem because he left his pipe. It is obvious that he likes this particular pipe very much.'
'How do you know that he likes it very much?' I asked.
'Well,' explained Holmes, 'I think this pipe costs around seven-and-sixpence. Now, look it has been mended twice with silver bands that probably cost more than the pipe itself. So, this man must like his pipe very much if he prefers to mend it instead of buying a new one with the same money.'
Just then, as Holmes was talking, we heard someone walking up the stairs, and then a man walked into the room without knocking.
'I beg your pardon,' said the man, 'I should have knocked, but I am very upset, and I need help.'
The man then took off his hat, and sat down on a chair.
'My dear Mr Grant Munro...' began Holmes.
Our visitor jumped from his chair. 'What!' he cried. 'You know my name?'

"Gareth climbed out of the freezer. He knocked a few small pieces of ice from his clothes, and stood up. He shook his head. A freezer technician was standing next to him. She was wearing a silver metal suit.
'Name?'
'Gareth ... Gareth Palmer.'
'Number?'
'Beta 4297.'
'Job?'
'Garden Technician, Class Four.'
'What are six threes?'
'Eighteen.'
'And nine fours?'
'Nine fours are thirty-six.'
'Where are you?'
'On the New Adventurer.'
'Where are we going?'
'To the star Orelia. Planet Five.'
The freezer technician put down her pen. She turned to the doctor. 'He's all right. No problems.'
She turned back to Gareth. 'You're OK, Beta 4297. You can go to your room. Dinner will be in forty minutes. Report for work at 18.00 hours.'
Gareth walked out of the Freezer Room. He was always a little nervous. It didn't happen very often, but every two or three months, someone didn't wake up, or they did wake up but they couldn't remember who they were or what they were doing. He thought about Philip. Philip was a garden technician, too. When he woke up last year he was like a baby. He couldn't speak or feed himself. They put him in the hospital for tests, but there was nothing they could do. They had to kill him. There was no room on a starship for passengers.
Gareth hurried to his room. He wanted a shower. That was always the first thing you wanted after two weeks in the freezer. He found his room, stopped and looked at the sign on the door.

"""Children, to-morrow I shall expect all of you to write compositions,""
said the teacher of Love Lane School. ""Then, on Friday those who have
done the best may stand up and read their compositions to the school.""

Some of the children were pleased, and some were not.

""What shall we write about?"" they asked.

""You may choose any subject that you like best,"" said the teacher.

Some of them thought that ""Home"" was a good subject. Others liked
""School."" One little boy chose ""The Horse."" A little girl said she
would write about ""Summer.""

The next day, every pupil except one had written a composition.

""Henry Longfellow,"" said the teacher, ""why have you not written?""

""Because I don't know how,"" answered Henry. He was only a child.

""Well,"" said the teacher, ""you can write words, can you not?""

""Yes, sir,"" said the boy.

""After you have written three or four words, you can put them together,
can you not?""

""Yes, sir; I think so.""

""Well, then,"" said the teacher, ""you may take your slate and go out
behind the schoolhouse for half an hour. Think of something to write
about, and write the word on your slate. Then try to tell what it is,
what it is like, what it is good for, and what is done with it. That
is the way to write a composition.""

Henry took his slate and went out. Just behind the schoolhouse was Mr.
Finney's barn. Quite close to the barn was a garden. And in the garden,
Henry saw a turnip.

"The Young Achiever of the Year

Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion and has just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree.

After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan and begin her own womenswear label.

Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over £500,000. Her clothes appear in fashion magazines, she designs for pop stars and she has just gained public recognition by winning this award. Her business has come a long way and she knows she is extremely lucky. 'What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this.'",B1
"In France there once lived a famous man who was known as the Marquis
de Lafayette. When he was a little boy his mother called him Gilbert.

Gilbert de Lafayette's father and grandfather and great-grandfather
had all been brave and noble men. He was very proud to think of this,
and he wished that he might grow up to be like them.

His home was in the country not far from a great forest. Often, when
he was a little lad, he took long walks among the trees with his
mother.

""Mother,"" he would say, ""do not be afraid. I am with you, and I will
not let anything hurt you.""

One day word came that a savage wolf had been seen in the forest. Men
said that it was a very large wolf and that it had killed some of the
farmers' sheep.

""How I should like to meet that wolf,"" said little Gilbert.

He was only seven years old, but now all his thoughts were about the
savage beast that was in the forest.

""Shall we take a walk this morning?"" asked his mother.

""Oh, yes!"" said Gilbert. ""Perhaps we may see that wolf among the trees.
But don't be afraid.""

His mother smiled, for she felt quite sure that there was no danger.

They did not go far into the woods. The mother sat down in the shade
of a tree and began to read a new book which she had bought the day
before. The boy played on the grass nearby.

It was two hours later, and I was still in my wet clothes. Sergeant McConnigal had come from the city police to question the witnesses to the murder. He had already talked to the officials, who had the best view of the pool, and now he was talking to me, Victoria (V. I.) Warshawski. He knew me already, of course.
I told him about my part in the events. Before leaving him, I asked what he had learnt about the dead woman. Her name was Louise Carmody, he said; she was twenty-four, and she worked for the Dearborn Bank. Nobody knew of any enemies.
Alicia was waiting for me in the hall. She looked worried. 'Can we talk?' she said.

'No, I didn't. Do the police know why she was shot?'

'Nothing. Will they put her name on the news?'

"It is early morning on a sunny spring day in April. Heathrow Airport, London, is busy, as usual. Hundreds of people are arriving, leaving, or waiting for planes.
In the Departure Lounge of Terminal One, a man is sitting reading a newspaper. He does not like airports. There are too many people, and he is always nervous when he flies. He looks at his watch impatiently. Then he hears the announcement over the loudspeakers.

Why had I come to this lonely place? I knew Roderick Usher - the owner of the house. We were old friends, but we had not met for many years. A few weeks ago, I had received a letter from Roderick.

I am ill - very ill. Please come and visit me. I am going mad! I want your help. We have been friends since we were boys. Please come!

A large lake of black water surrounded the house. I stopped by the lake and looked at the house. Roderick Usher's house was a large black building. Its many windows were like empty eyes. Suddenly, I felt cold...and a little afraid.
In front of me, a narrow road went across a bridge toward the house. I walked my horse along the narrow road until I reached the walls of the house.
I knocked on the front door and a servant opened it. He took my horse to a stable. Then he led me inside the house.
We climbed many stairs to his master's room. Lamps burned along the walls, but they gave little light. The long corridors and stairways were full of dark shadows.

Gareth Ellis, 13, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth's dream was always to become a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath and Gareth joined the circus. 'People laugh when we tell them,' says Kath. 'But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three.'
When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to see if they could find full-time circus jobs. They both got jobs with a famous circus and Gareth began training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus during the summer and return home for the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to look after the house while they are away.

"Detective-Inspector Cornish and Chief-Inspector Craddock were discussing the murder at the local police station.
'Mrs Bantry said that Marina Gregg had a ""frozen look""', said Cornish. 'Did she see someone on the stairs? There were two people from America - Ardwyck Fenn and Lola Brewster, a film star. There was a girl from London with a camera, but she had been there for half an hour already.'

"Moonshine 

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ‘Here again’ is a followup to ‘The Waves’. There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums.
It is clear from the first song on the CD which is a dance tune that the band is no longer going to concentrate on slow songs. The second tune is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most later lacks are in the bands more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single though because they are excellent.
Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has rented in the band having to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as dl the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.)
On this CD Moonshine show they can produce perfect music in a variety of styles from the slow ones we are familiar with to the ones that will keep your feet tapping. I did feel though that they put their best songs at the beginning and the last few tracks were not of quite the same quality. Despite thisHere again is certain to be a big hit and bring more success to this band.

"The Ghan Train 

Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. 

The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’, which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. 
The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide as far as Alice Springs, but there was often serious flooding on the line making it difficult for trains to pass. A new line was completed a few months before my journey. 
The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph and the Ghan is certainly not a high- speed, inter-city train – there are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. Nor does the Ghan aim to provide luxury in the same way that a train like the Orient Express does, although the on-board food is excellent. 
The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia’s densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. 
It is not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world’s first north–south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I could see that everyone was really looking forward to the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up the majority of my fellow travellers, were particularly keen to board. 
Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn’t leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged nowadays and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. 
From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn’t particularly interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with nothing to look at but cattle. But at dawn on the third day we reached the foothills of an area close to the Southern Ocean. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.

"Maria Mutola

In 1988, Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won,' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.'
The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, learnt about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realised immediately that she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I had no idea what he meant. The only sport I knew about was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me training. It was such hard work and my legs really ached.' But Jose visited her parents and persuaded them she could be successful and this would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her away to train.
In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was unlike those of the girls she met in the US. She explains, 'They were good athletes but, while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were brilliant and I learnt a lot.'
Today, Maria still runs and for most of the year she lives happily in South Africa with her mother.",B1

"On 24th February 1815 the ship Pharaoh came in to Marseilles. A man on the shore jumped into a boat and went out to the ship.
A young man, about twenty years old, looked over the side of the ship. He seemed to be the captain. He was the type of man who meets danger without fear.
'Oh! Is it you, Dantes?' cried the man in the boat. 'What has happened?'
'A very sad thing, Mr Morrel,' replied the young man. 'When our ship was near Civitavecchia, we lost our brave Captain Leclerc.'
He turned to his men and gave a quick order. Then he turned again to Morrel. The Pharaoh was Morrel's ship, and Edmond Dantes was First Officer.
'We will all die one day, Edmond,' said Morrel. 'The goods …?'
'They are safe, Mr Morrel. Now, come on board. Here is Danglars. He does all the buying and selling. I must look after my ship.'
Morrel climbed quickly onto the ship and met Danglars. Danglars was about twenty-five years old. Nobody on the Pharaoh liked him.
'Well, Mr Morrel,' said Danglars. 'You heard about the sad death of Captain Leclerc?'
'Yes. He was a brave and good man.'
'And a good seaman. He was old and wise, a good ship's captain for Morrel and Son,' replied Danglars.
'A young man can be a good captain, too,' Morrel said. 'Look at our friend Edmond. He works well.'
'Yes,' said Danglars. He looked at Dantes. He did not like him. 'Yes, he is young and he is very sure of himself. When the captain died, we had to take orders from him. And as a result, we lost a day and a half at the island of Elba. We needed to come straight to Marseilles.'

"City life is cool; but is country life cooler?
    Apparently yes.
    More and more people in Britain want to live in the country, and this is causing more and more problems in some rural areas.
    The population of British cities has been falling for years. Cities like Liverpool and Glasgow have lost about 30% of their population in 30 years. But Britain's population is still growing. Where are the people going?
    Answer: to the country.
    The English countryside has a classic image. People imagine that life in the country is slow and calm; that there are no traffic jams,  no pollution, and no crime. In some places, this is true; but in others it is not.
    Small towns and villages are becoming more and more popular; people have more space and most houses have gardens. But problems are growing. Lots of people want to live in the country and work in the city; so more and more people travel long distances each day, to go to work. Of course they don't use buses (they are too slow) or trains (they don't stop in the country); they use cars. And although they live in the country, they want to use supermarkets and good fast roads ... but they do not want to see them or hear them. Besides, lots of young people say that life in the country is boring: there is not enough to do, there are not enough activities and excitements.
    Little villages now have traffic problems in the morning, just like big cities! And they are getting worse.

Tom Cruise is one of the most successful actors in cinema history. However, life hasn't always been that easy for him. As a young boy, Tom was shy and had difficulty in finding friends, although he really enjoyed taking part in school plays. 
After he had finished High School, Tom went to New York to look for work. He found employment as a porter, and at the same time he attended drama classes. In 1980, the film director Franco Zeffirelli offered Tom his first part in a film. Ten years later, he had become so successful that he was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, earning millions of dollars for each film. 
Today, Tom still appears in films and is as popular as ever with his thousands of fans from all around the world.

"For many years, I shared an apartment in London with my friend, Sherlock Holmes.
My name is Doctor Watson. I worked as a doctor in the British Army for several years. While I was in the army, I travelled to many strange and interesting places. I had many exciting adventures.
Then one day, in Afghanistan, I was shot in the shoulder. My wound was deep and took many months to heal. I nearly died from pain and fever. At last I got better, but I could not work in the army any more. I retired from the army and came back to England.
That is why I was living in London with Sherlock Holmes. I had known my friend for many years. Our address was 221B Baker Street, in the centre of the city.
I enjoyed sharing an apartment with Holmes. My friend was a very clever man. He was the most famous private detective1 in London. He helped to solve crimes and catch criminals.
When people were in trouble or needed help, they came to Holmes. Sometimes the police came to Holmes and asked for help in catching a criminal.
Sherlock Holmes did not care if his clients were rich or poor. He enjoyed solving their interesting problems. He was very happy when he was working. It was the most important thing in his life.
One afternoon, I was reading a book and Holmes was standing by the window in our sitting-room. Usually he was very busy and active. But this afternoon he did not seem very happy. I was worried about my friend.

"At breakfast that morning, only Sally and her father are at the table.
""Where's Mr Dalton?"" asks Sally when Mrs Larkin comes from the kitchen.
""Oh, he was up very early,"" she replies. ""He had to catch a ferry to France. He needed to be in Paris for a meeting this morning.""
""Why didn't he fly?"" asks the inspector.
""He needed his car with him,"" replies Mrs Larkin quickly, and her cheeks begin to redden. ""Now, what can I get you for breakfast?""
""A full English breakfast for me,"" says the inspector. ""Could I have a fried egg, please?""
""And for me, two poached eggs on toast, please,"" says Sally. When Mrs Larkin returns to the kitchen, they both look at each other.
""It's strange that Mr Dalton left so early for the ferry. If he needed his car in Paris, he could have gone on the Eurotunnel train with it,"" says the inspector.
""Perhaps he likes to drive,"" Sally replies. ""He left early. I heard his car in the yard when it was still dark. It woke me.""
""I didn't hear that,"" says her father, ""but I did hear something else.""
He then tells her about the shot that he heard in the night. ""Really?'' gasps Sally. ""You don't think that had anything to do with Mr Dalton leaving early, do you?""
""I hope not,"" answers her father.
""And Mr Larkin said it was poachers?"" Sally continues. ""That's terrible. I hate to think that people go around with guns and kill poor animals in the middle of the night. The world would be a better place without guns.""

HORIZON: Right. And do either of you take part in any cultural activities?
SIMON: Yes.... I watch quite a few cultural programmes on telly. And I like drawing too.
ERIC: Well I watch quite a lot of films, mainly on the box. That's cultural, I suppose.
SIMON: It depends on the film really, doesn't it? I mean, some films are cultural, but there's plenty that aren't. I mean, you couldn't call Jurassic Park culture, could you?
HORIZON: What about Titanic? Was that culture?

"A terrible disease came to this country. The illness was called the Red Death. No one was safe. Soon many people were sick. There was no help - no cure. The Red Death killed half of the people in this land.
Prince Prospero - the ruler of this country - wanted to escape from the terrible disease. He called all his courtiers to his castle on the top of a hill. When all of the most powerful people in the land were inside the castle, the gates and doors were closed. They were fastened and no one could get in or out.
Prince Prospero had plenty of food inside the castle. And there was plenty of wine to drink. He did not think about the rest of the people in his land. Prince Prospero told his courtiers to enjoy themselves.
""Forget about the Red Death,"" he said. ""The disease is outside the castle walls. I don't want to think about the Red Death. I don't want to hear about the Red Death. I don't want to see the Red Death. I want everyone to be happy!""
The prince prepared a masque for his courtiers. There was going to be music for dancing. There was going to be wonderful food to eat. There was going to be good wine to drink. Dancers and singers were going to entertain the guests. Everyone was going to wear masks. Their faces were going to be hidden by the masks.
There were seven special rooms in the castle. Each room was a different color. And each room had a great window in one of its walls. The glass in each of these windows was a different color. At night, a fire burned outside each window. The light of the flames shone through the windows.

"The Eden Project 

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight, the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. 

Each biosphere contains a different climate zone, showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is amazing to see just how many products that we use every day come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plant are grown here. However cold the weather is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. 
In the Rainforest Zone, the atmosphere is always damp because of a huge waterfall. Another zone reproduces the environment of the Mediterranean, California and South Africa, and there are plans to build a desert zone in the near future.

"Letter to the Newport Evening News

On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book, address book and my purse, which contained about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old, I was a long way from home, and I was quite worried. In fact, I stood by the side of the road and just cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened he said I should keep the fare.
I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would just like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

"It's all right, Rick. It's only the post,' she called.
Six or seven thick brown envelopes lay on the doormat. Marilyn picked them up and took them into the kitchen. Rick was sitting at the table. He was finishing his breakfast.
'Is there anything for me?' he asked.
'They're all from estate agents,' she said. 'I hope there's something this time.'
She put three envelopes down in front of Rick, and began to open the others herself. They had been looking for a house for three months. They were tired of the small flat, and they were tired of paying rent every week. They had been saving to buy their own house for nearly two years. They began looking through the letters from estate agents.
Rick looked up. 'Here's one,' he said. 'Listen. Perfect first home. Two bedrooms, large living room, modern kitchen, bathroom, garage, small garden. And it's in Balmoral Avenue, on the new housing estate. $68,000. What do you think?'
'What number is it?' she asked.
'Er... let me see. Thirty-five. Yes, thirty-five Balmoral Avenue.'
'That's funny,' she said. 'I've just been reading about the same house. Look, here's an advert from Norman and Naylor. I phoned them yesterday.'
'Ah, my advert's from Burchill and Bradley. Yes, it's the same house. Well, that's normal. They've put the house with two estate agents. Which one shall we phone?'
'It doesn't really matter,' said Marilyn. 'Give me the adverts. I'll phone when I get to work.'

"I couldn't believe what I'd done. I'd run away - me!
I'm not very brave and I love my parents very much. I never thought I could ever disobey them.
I was afraid. And I felt sad for my parents. Poor mother and father!
But I had to live my own life. I couldn't get married to a horrible old man like Buffalo!
I knew they would follow me quickly so I told the spaceship to take me to a very quiet part of the Galaxy, a long way from any planets with people on.
The spaceship went.
How can a spaceship travel across the Galaxy in no time at all?
Well, I learnt the answer to that in school. There are a lot of little black holes in space. They are about as big as a potato. A spaceship goes into one black hole and comes out of another black hole on the other side of the Galaxy.
Don't ask me how a big thing like a spaceship can go into a thing as small as a potato. I was probably asleep when the robot teacher told me the answer to that!
Nobody could find me now. I was in the middle of the Galaxy in empty space.
There were stars above my head, stars below my feet, stars on my left hand, stars on my right hand.
Strange. I knew all these stars were a long, long way away but they didn't look far away. They looked very close; I wanted to reach out my hand and touch them.
And the silence. So very, very, very quiet.

"CARTOON FILMS 

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. 
By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. 
But soon afterwards, one or two directors had some original new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. 
However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed, mainly because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learnt from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

"To be sure that I wasn't late the next day, I got up early and was down at breakfast by seven o'clock.
Ellen was already there, and when she waved to me, I took my breakfast over to her table.
'Morning,' I said. 'May I join you?'
She smiled at me. 'Please do.'
I sat down and put sugar in my coffee. 'Did you enjoy your afternoon in Nice?' I asked.
Ellen nodded. 'Oh yes,' she said. 'I did lots of shopping. It's a very good thing our bags go by bus.' She looked at me. 'How did you and Grant do with your shopping?' Something about the way she was looking at me made my face go red. 'Fine,' I said, and she smiled.
'He's a very handsome man,' she said.
'Is he?' I said.
'Don't you think so?' continued Ellen.
'I haven't really thought about it,' I said, which of course wasn't the truth. I just wanted to talk about something else. 'Are you looking forward to today's walk?' I asked.
Ellen smiled again. 'Yes,' she said, 'very much.'
At that moment Grant came into the restaurant, and both Ellen and I looked his way. He wasn't alone. A tall woman with black hair was holding his hand.
'Who is that?' Ellen asked me, not sounding pleased. Grant saw us and called over, 'Good morning, ladies. Beautiful morning, isn't it?'

"Who were you talking to?' asked Ruth, coming into the sitting room now the children were asleep at last. 'Stephany,' said Carlo.
'Why does Stephany want our flat for her holiday? Why can't she find her own hotel or something?' Ruth asked.
'You know I promised Stephany she could use the flat. It was before I knew you. I can't suddenly change my mind, just because we're married.'
'I just think giving someone my home is unnecessary'
'But the flat isn't your home,' said Carlo. 'You didn't want to live in the flat, remember? You didn't like living in the village. You wanted a bigger house. This house is your home, not the flat. The flat is empty and it is much better if someone uses it.'
'You never asked me how I felt about it,' said Ruth. She knew she sounded a bit like a child, but she couldn't help it.
'I didn't know you when I made the promise,' Carlo said. 'I can't suddenly tell her she can't have it. If I make a promise, I like to keep it.'
Ruth knew this. It was one of the things she loved about Carlo. He was very honest, and if he said he would do something he always did it.
Ruth was always surprised that Carlo had married her.
She didn't think she was very pretty. Not like the Italian girls he knew, and she hated her red hair.
Carlo promised her he didn't like women just because they looked good and dressed nicely.
'One of the things I like about people from Britain,' he said, 'is they don't worry about fashion. Not like Italian women.'

""You mean you'd charm them? Once the Montague men were gone?""
""Yes. I guess so.""
""But that's not really showing them that you're angry. Unless you think charming the women is the same as fighting the men.""
""Isn't it?"" Sampson answered. ""Either way, it's about showing the Montagues who's the boss. I'll beat the men with swords, the women with smiles and pretty words. It's all the same.""
""I wish it were the same,"" said Gregory, seeing two servants from the Montague family approaching from across the square. ""Then you could just smile and say kind things to these two and be satisfied.""

"Look!' Jane Cole said. 'Here she comes now!'
The two Americans looked along the street. There were crowds of people everywhere. In the middle of the road, soldiers were riding towards them on horseback. Behind them came a golden coach, pulled by six black horses.
'That's my father, 'Jane said. 'He's the coachman - the man driving the horses.'
The American woman said, 'Fantastic! Your father's driving the Queen! Quick, Harry, use the video camera!'
'I am using it!' her husband said. 'But she's too far away. Can't we get a little nearer, Jane?'
'We can try,' Jane said. 'Follow me!' She took them nearer to the entrance to Parliament. 'This is where the coach will stop and the Queen will get out. Then she'll go upstairs to open Parliament for this year.'
'Didn't someone put a bomb under your Parliament once?' the American man asked. 'I read about that at school. Guy... something?'
'Guy Fawkes,' Jane said. 'In 1605. He tried to blow up Parliament, that's right. But don't worry. There's no Guy Fawkes here today.'
She smiled at the Americans. She was a student, and this was her part-time job - to show tourists round London. She felt proud to show them her father, driving the Queen on a wonderful day like this.
Then the Queen's coach came past in front of them, the golden roof bright in the sunlight.
There were people everywhere, trying to take photos. Jane saw a woman with red-brown hair behind the American man, pressing the button of her camera. That's stupid, Jane thought, she can only see the backs of people's heads there. The woman shook her camera angrily; there seemed to be something wrong with it.

‘I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people’s opinions on hip hop music. I sat in a room with a team of young journalists and was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age wasn’t important, they were trusted to do the stories on their own. 
I started going to the Eight-eighteen centre in my city, got some training, then was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen has helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With all the skills I learnt, I got a job at 19, and am currently the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles written by the journalists before putting them onto the site.’ 

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you’ll be trained and you’ll take part in monthly meetings to decide who is going to be responsible for writing each news story.
Eight-eighteen encourages skills-sharing between members. ‘Peer trainers’ are experienced Eight-eighteen members who are 12 years old and over. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they become more experienced as trainers, some members present sessions to audiences of young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips.
Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next new-members’ training will be in February. If you, or someone you know, is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen programme is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free and there is no test to join.

"I pulled the curtains open and looked down at the street. It was hot, too hot for London in the middle of July and I was angry. I closed the curtains and returned to my mother's room. She lay in bed and I could hear her breathing. She looked so thin and I sat next to her and held her hand.
'I'm not going,' I said. 'You can't send me away.' I looked at my mother and her face was white like the sheets and pillowcases.
'It's only for a month, until I feel a little better, my darling,' she said. 'Then you can come home.'
Doctor Barns stood on the other side of the bed. 'Has Megan got any friends?' he asked Mrs Brown, our home help.
Mrs Brown shook her head. 'Megan doesn't have any friends,' I heard her whisper. 'She's a strange child.'
Friends! Of course I didn't have any friends. We moved to this part of London six months ago and my new school was horrible. Mother didn't know. I didn't tell her about the bullies and the nasty text messages.
Doctor Barns put his glasses on. I could see that he didn't know what to do. We needed a miracle. 'Your mother is very unwell, Megan,' he said. 'She needs to rest and you can't stay here for the summer holidays.'
'I don't want to leave you, Mum. You want to send me to the Highlands of Scotland to stay with Uncle Fraser, but I hate the countryside.' I stood up and looked at the doctor. 'I'm not going and you can't make me go!'
But Doctor Barns could make me go... and he did.

"Joining the Kirov Ballet 

I’m Nathalie. Last year I was one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov’s ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous as I didn’t know anyone. Everyone gathered round, asking me questions, all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved enormously and I understand my teachers. 
For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me and when she left, I was a bit sad. In fact, I called home late at night once to speak to her because I felt a little lonely. 
Compared with my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. That makes me confident I can perform to the school’s high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. 
Now that I’ve settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops – even during December when I couldn’t believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10oC, but the Russians said it was mild for the time of year! At least it was warm and cosy in my room. At the moment we are preparing for a new production and there’s also a competition for young dancers which I’m going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.

"I am Professor Aronnax. My job is to study everything dead or alive under the sea. I see beautiful and ugly things down there. Bur there is one strange experience that stays in my mind like a nightmare.
It was 1867. Some sailors said that they saw a dangerous giant monster living in the cold waters of the ocean. Some ships tried to find it and kill it, but they never returned.
People said it looked like a whale.
""It was 300 feet long!""
""Water came out of its back. It was like a big, underwater explosion!""
The largest whale was only 180 feet long and if these men were right, this was even larger. I was famous because I was the writer of a book called The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths. When the captain of the American ship the Abraham Lincoln decided to leave and look for the monster, he asked me to go with them as an expert.
The idea was very exciting. I invited my faithful assistant and good friend Conseil to go with me. He always helps me to organise the names and places of the wonderful strange sea creatures that we find in the oceans of the world. He accepted the invitation and we got ready to go.
The Abraham Lincoln left New York harbour on the 3rd of July, 1867. Five hundred thousand people were there to say goodbye. Ned Land, the famous whale killer, was also on the ship. Farragut, the captain of the ship, was a strong and brave man. When we first met, he shook my hand and smiled at me.

"Patience worked hard on her designs all day. By the time she had finished, it was half past eleven at night and everyone else in the office had gone home. There was no one to take her designs to George Hedare at the factory. Patience decided to take them to him herself.
She didn't have much time, so she took a taxi to the Hedare Beauty factory. She tried a door but it was locked. She looked at her watch. 'Oh no! It's almost too late,' she thought.
She shouted as loudly as she could, 'Hello? Is anyone there?' But there was no reply.
Then she saw some lights at the back of the factory. She walked towards them and found another door. Luckily it was open. Patience went in.
She could hear people talking in a room not far away. She walked towards the room.
'I don't care if women get terrible headaches when they use Beau-line,' Dr Slavicky was saying. 'I can live with that. And I don't care if women can't stop using Beau-line. That will make me very rich! But I don't want to destroy women's faces. I won't do it.'
Patience looked into the room and saw a video screen. On the screen there was a woman's face. It was an old face, with lots of lines. Then, slowly, the face began to change. It became younger and younger. The lines disappeared. But the face continued to change. It became hard like a stone. The skin began to crack.
Patience turned and ran. She crashed into a table.
'Who's there?' shouted Slavicky.

"So next day, at seven o'clock, I came to the shop in a cab. There were not very many people in the road, because it was early in the morning. In November it is dark at seven o'clock in the morning, and I could not see the shop very well. I waited five minutes. A postman walked past. Then the door of the shop opened, and the creature, Merrick, came out.
I could not see his face or his body. He had an enormous black hat on his head, like a big box. A grey cloth came down from the hat, in front of his face. There was a hole in the cloth in front of his eyes. He could see out of the hole but I could not see in. He wore a long black coat, too. The coat began at his neck, and ended at his feet, so I could not see his arms, his body, or his legs. On his feet he wore big shoes, like old bags.
He had a stick in his left hand, and he walked very slowly. I opened the door of the cab, and got out.
'Good morning, Mr Merrick,' I said. 'Can you get in?'
'Elpmyupasteps,' he said.
'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I don't understand.'
For a minute he stood by the door of the cab and said nothing. Then he hit the cab with his stick.
'STEPS!' he said loudly. 'Help me up the steps!'
Then I understood. There were three steps up into the cab, and he could not get up them.
'Yes, I see. I'm sorry,' I said. 'Let me help you.'

"Mr Williams turned to the bank staff and said, ""Please, continue to work as normal. There is nothing to worry about.""
Everyone looked surprised. How could they work without computers? It would be impossible. No one moved and no one spoke. Mr Williams repeated his message: ""Back to work now, please. Our clients will arrive soon and we must be ready."" As his staff slowly began to return to work, the bank manager sat down in front of the server. Belinda stood next to him. Mr Williams looked at the screen. He was now extremely worried. He hesitated for a moment. Belinda thought he was in difficulty and she wanted to help. ""You have to click on the e-mail icon in the comer of the screen,"" she said. ""I know, I know. I'm not completely stupid!"" her boss shouted. Some members of staff looked at one another and smiled. Belinda knew Mr Williams well. She knew that when he was angry, as he was now, it was better to say nothing. She watched silently as he clicked on the icon. The mailbox appeared and revealed the subject of the new message:
Are you ready to play, Henry Williams?
Yes, he was ready. He had no idea who had sent the e-mail but he wanted an explanation and an end to this situation. He opened the message and the screen filled with words.
Hello Henry!
How are you today? Happy? Or maybe worried? Or even angry! I haven't seen you for a long time but I can tell you that I am very, very annoyed with you. You are not my favorite person. How many enemies do you have? AT least one - me! I am going to make you pay for what you did to me before.

"Behind the town, up in the mountain, was a famous warm lake. Swimmers often went there. That day, two visitors, a young man and a young woman, walked up to the lake for a swim. The trees were green, the sun was in the sky. It was quiet and beautiful.
The woman put her foot in the water. 'Ow!' she said. 'It's hot!'
'Yes,' said her friend, 'I know. The lake is famous.'
They laughed, and walked into the water. They played and swam. 'This is good,' said the young woman. 'Do you want to come and live here?'
'No, it's too quiet,' said the man. 'Nothing exciting happens.'
Suddenly birds flew up from the trees, and they heard the sound of animals. 'Why are the animals running away?' she asked.
'I don't know,' he answered. He pulled her under the water, and she laughed.
Suddenly, there was a small earthquake. Now the woman was afraid. She swam over to the man. Under the lake rocks moved and the ground opened. Hot gas exploded into the lake. She screamed. 'The water!' she cried. 'It's too hot! It's...' They were her last words.
Soon the lake was quiet again.
From the school, Rachel went to find her daughter. A tall, dark-eyed man walked up to her and said, 'Hi! I'm Harry Dalton, from the United States Volcano Office, and...'
But Les Worrell and Elliot Blair came up to Rachel with smiles on their faces. 'Well done, Rachel!' Les said, before Harry could say anything more.
'You're a good speaker,' Blair said.
'Thank you,' Rachel said. But she didn't want Dalton and Blair to meet. Blair wanted to make Dante's Peak a holiday town, Dalton was from the Volcano Office. No, she didn't want them to meet.

"They went to an empty table. A waiter came up to them and took their orders. At that moment there was a cheer from the party beside the window. An older man in a light grey suit was standing up. He spoke for a few minutes and then held up his glass. All the others stood up, and looked at a young girl with large gold ear-rings, who was sitting in the chair next to him. Everyone was laughing, and then they began to sing 'Happy birthday to you'. They were all looking at the girl, but she herself just sat there without a smile on her face. The song came to an end, and there was another loud cheer and more laughing and shouting. Someone called out 'Twenty-one today, twenty-one today...', and this time everyone in the restaurant sang too.
Suddenly there was a loud crash. Then someone screamed and a voice shouted, 'Bring a towel - quickly.'
The man in the grey suit was lying across the table. He was holding his face, which was red with blood. On the table there was broken glass.
Someone said in a loud voice, 'What happened - did he fall?' Several people were speaking at the same time. 'It's his heart, you know...'
'Joe's been in and out of hospital for years...'
'His head hit those glasses'.
The man was still lying across the table. Jennifer jumped up, and both she and Claire ran over to him.

"William was busy as usual, in the building which was the office for Helping Hand. He worked there every Saturday morning. Today the building was full of teenagers, all waiting for someone to tell them what to do and where to go.
""Sally, Mrs Smith needs someone to collect her shopping.""
Sally went to the desk and took the shopping list for Mrs Smith, then with a smile on her pretty face said goodbye and walked out of the office.
""John, Mrs Jones wants you to take her dog for a walk.
And be careful not to step on the dog this time.""
""Gary, can you babysit for the Smiths this afternoon?""
""Jo, Mr Brown needs help in his garden.""
The telephone never stopped ringing, but slowly, as time passed, the office became calm again. Most of the teenagers were out helping the people of the town, the rest were by the coffee machine. Someone switched on the cassette player and William sat in his chair more comfortably and closed his eyes.
""Hello.""
William opened his eyes. A lovely girl stood in front of his desk, smiling.
""Hello, young lady. Who are you?""
""I'm Kathy. I'm new here and I don't know anybody, so I thought perhaps I could help you.""
""You said the magic word. Help is always needed round here. In fact, as soon as Joan gets back, I'm taking the Library van to the Old People's Home and I need someone to help with the small trolley. Why don't you get some coffee and meet the rest of the group?""

"At that moment Skip realized how much he hated Frosby. His blood boiled with anger.
Edward (Skip) Skipperton spent most of his life feeling angry. It was his nature. When he was a boy he had a bad temper; now, as a man, he was impatient with people who were slow or stupid. He often met such people in his work, which was to give advice on managing companies. He was good at his job: he could see when people were doing something the wrong way, and he told them in a loud, clear voice how to do it better. The company directors always followed his advice.
Now Skipperton was fifty-two. His wife had left him two years ago, because she couldn't live with his bad temper. She had met a quiet university teacher in Boston, ended her marriage with Skip and married the teacher. Skip wanted very much to keep their daughter, Maggie, who was then fifteen. With the help of clever lawyers he succeeded.
A few months after he separated from his wife, Skip had a heart attack. He was better again in six months, but his doctor gave him some strong advice.
'Stop smoking and drinking now, or you're a dead man, Skip! And I think you should leave the world of business, too - you've got enough money. Why don't you buy a small farm, and live quietly in the country?'
So Skip looked around, and bought a small farm in Maine with a comfortable farmhouse. A little river, the Coldstream, ran along the bottom of the garden, and the house was called Coldstream Heights. He found a local man, Andy Humbert, to live on the farm and work for him.

"The next day, Emma was pleased to see a lot of snow outside. This was a good thing because it meant she could not go to church and see Mr Elton, or go to visit Harriet, and none of them could meet. The snow stayed for several days after Christmas and the only visitor to Hartfield was Mr Knightley.
As soon as the snow disappeared, Isabella, John and the children went back to London. The same evening, a letter arrived for Mr Woodhouse from Mr Elton. It said he was leaving Highbury the next day and going to Bath to spend a few weeks with friends. There was no message in the letter for Emma and she was a little angry about that, but also pleased he was going away. She knew the next thing she must do was to speak to Harriet and tell her everything.
Harriet cried, but she did not blame Emma at all for what had happened. They went back to Hartfield together and Emma tried very hard to make Harriet feel better, but she knew only time could help her to forget. Perhaps when Mr Elton returned they might all be able to meet without feeling embarrassed.
Mr Frank Churchill did not come. He wrote a letter of excuse and in it he said, I hope to come to Randall's quite soon.
Both Mr and Mrs Weston were very sorry but they decided perhaps the spring was a better time to visit and maybe he could stay for a longer time then. Emma gave Mr Knightley the news and blamed the Churchills, especially his aunt. Mr Knightley did not agree.

"Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So, what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car, recycling wine bottles, not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out.
I want to be clear about one thing right from the start - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man. I had just started working for the BBC and on my first day the editor asked me to come into his office. What did I think about the idea of a journalist trying to live as ethical a lifestyle as possible for a year, he wanted to know. He asked me if I liked the idea. What did I think? It was my first day; I said I thought it was a great idea!
That's why my family (Bee, my wife, thirty-five, and daughters Eva, five and Zola, four) and I agreed to spend a year doing everything we could to try to reduce our impact on the environment. We changed the light bulbs in our house to energy-saving bulbs. We changed the way we heat and power our home. We stopped flying and we got rid of the car. Instead we walked, used bicycles, or took public transport. 
We did our supermarket shopping online, ate organic vegetables and I even stopped eating meat (for a month). My heavily pregnant wife, Bee, walked two miles to hospital in the middle of the night, to give birth to our third daughter, Elsa. When we went on holiday to France, instead of choosing a two-hour flight, we went on a nightmarish twelve-hour journey on the train, in a heatwave.

"The Skywalk 

The Grand Canyon in the United States was created by the River Colorado. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to go walking and running but mainly to look at the view. It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres. It is a platform whose walls and floor are built of glass so that you can see the beautiful rocks of the canyon. Up to 120 people are allowed to stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007 and since then thousands of people have used it. You have to wear special covers over your shoes to avoid scratching the glass beneath your feet. Walking onto the Skywalk makes you feel like a bird floating high up in the air.

"Write a winning story!

You could win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story printed in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky people will win a cheque for£100.
Once again, we need people who can write good stories. The judges, who include Mary Littlejohn, the novelist, Michael Brown, the television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, Keep Writing's editor, are looking for interesting and original stories. Detective fiction was extremely popular last year, although the competition winner produced a love story. You can write about whatever you want but here's some advice to start you thinking:
Write about what you know
This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends - these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way.
Get your facts right
It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it.
Hold the reader's attention
Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end.
Think about the characters
Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.
Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words and typed, double-spaced, on one side only of each sheet of paper.
Even if you're in danger of missing the closing date, we are unable to accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately your story cannot be returned, nor can we discuss our decisions.
You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country - a change in the rules by popular request- and the story must not have appeared in print or in recorded form, for example on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.
Your fee of £5 will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to:
The closing date is 30 July and we will inform the winner within one month of this date. Please note that if you win, you must agree to have your story printed in our magazine.",B1

"I was one of the few lucky passengers on the Lady Vain. When the ship went down in the Pacific in February 1887, I found myself in a small boat with another passenger, Helmar, and a sailor. I never knew the sailor's name. A fourth man jumped from the ship, trying to reach us. But his head hit the side of the ship. He went down under the water and never came up again.
We had only a little bread and a small container of water on board. On the first day, the sea was very rough and we were almost thrown out of the boat. But then the sea became calmer and that danger passed. We spoke little. Most of the time, we did not move. We lay under the hot sun, looking out across the ocean.
On the fourth day, we had no more water to drink. We became very thirsty. Then on the sixth day, Helmar finally spoke of the idea that was already in all our minds. 'We need to kill someone. Then the other two can drink his blood.'
Helmar had two longer sticks and one shorter one. The person with the short stick had to die. But the sailor chose the short stick and he did not accept the result. The love of life was too strong in him. He attacked Helmar, and the two men fought. I tried to help Helmar. But as I was going towards them, the boat moved suddenly. Helmar and the sailor fell straight over the side together and went down like stones.
In my weak state, I lay in the boat, laughing quietly. I did not know why I was laughing. But for many minutes I could not stop.

"Somewhere a telephone was ringing. Howard could hear it in his dream, but it didn't wake him up. It was dark in his dream, dark and terrible.
He was running, but it was like running through deep water. There were trees all around him, trees which tried to stop him. They reached out with their branches. And it was behind him. It was coming nearer. He wanted to shout for help. He was opening his mouth wide. But there was no sound. He could hear the noise it was making behind him - the heavy feet, the heavy breathing.
He was terrified. He looked behind... He could see it! He could see the burning eyes, the yellow teeth. Oh, no! It was coming nearer. A few more steps and then...
The telephone was still ringing. 'Don't answer it,' Howard shouted.
Suddenly he was awake. His body was hot and wet. The bedclothes were nearly off the bed. He was awake and safe. It was only a dream! He tried to pull the bedclothes back onto the bed. But something was wrong. His arm felt strange. He lifted his head, and looked. Beside his bed, there was a metal pole.
There was a tube coming from it. His arm was tied to it. He let his head fall back on the bed. Then he knew what it was. He was in hospital. But why?
He was probably a patient. He was ill, or hurt. Maybe he had been in an accident. He tried to think, but he couldn't remember. This happened sometimes after accidents, people said. You forgot what had happened just before, but... Howard felt cold around his heart.

"Mum often looked at me strangely when I came back from the shop. 'We didn't need any apples, Samantha,' she said once. 'I bought some yesterday.' And another time, 'We've already got biscuits in the cupboard.'
On Saturdays I always wanted to go to the shop, but I always felt afraid too. I never felt very comfortable as I walked across the road. I played with the money in my pocket like a child going to buy sweets. And then sometimes when I got to the shop I waited for a moment outside, reading the postcards in the window. People who want to sell things write about them on a postcard and the young man puts them in the window: 'Car, five years old. Cat needs good home, large fridge, nearly new.'
One Saturday I read all of the postcards twice before I went into the shop. Then, when I was inside, I didn't know what to buy. Mum and I always go to the supermarket on Fridays and I really didn't want anything. The young man was busy selling bread and cakes to a woman with two children. This gave me time to think, and in the end I decided to buy a newspaper.
The shop was often very busy on Saturdays. Usually the young man just had time to smile at me and take my money. But that morning it was different. After the woman and her children left, the shop was empty. There was only me and the young man.

"The hot summer passed and the cool autumn arrived.
The Jamestown settlers had little food to eat. Many settlers were ill and weak. They needed help.
When winter arrived there was no food. Pocahontas helped the Jamestown settlers. She asked her father for corn, meat and other food. Pocahontas and other Indians brought the food to Jamestown in big baskets. The courageous Indian princess helped the settlers to live during the cold winter.
Ships came to Jamestown from England. Powhatan was not happy about this. More white men came to the New World. Powhatan was afraid of them. He was afraid of the future.
One winter day Powhatan sent an Indian messenger to Jamestown. He had a message for Captain Smith. ""My chief Powhatan wants to speak to you. Follow me."" John Smith followed the messenger to Powhatan's village.
Powhatan was in his longhouse. John Smith sat next to him. ""We have no more food to give to your people. You must all leave this land now,"" said Powhatan.
""Why must we leave?"" asked John Smith.
The two men talked for a long time. At midnight Powhatan said, ""It is very late. You can sleep in the small cabin near the river.""
Captain Smith accepted the invitation. He went to sleep in the small cabin.
During the night, John Smith heard someone at the door. He got up, opened the door and saw Pocahontas. ""What a surprise to see you, Pocahontas! Please come in!""
""Oh, Captain Smith, your life is in danger. My father and the medicine men want to kill you tonight! They don't want white people to stay here. You must run away now.""

"I woke up, but there was something wrong. Then I knew what it was. It was the silence. There was no sound of cars or traffic. Nothing. I opened my window and listened and then I heard a bird sing and a sheep call under my window.
I dressed quickly and went downstairs. A big cat sat in front of the fire. It looked like a tiger with its red, white and grey stripes. My uncle was in the kitchen.
'Good morning, Megan. Did you sleep well?'
'Yes, I did. I slept very well,' I said 'and I saw the silvery-white horse again Uncle Fraser, before I went to sleep.'
My uncle looked surprised, but he said nothing and put two bowls on the table.
'Why do you look surprised, Uncle Fraser, when I tell you about the white horse?'
Uncle Fraser sat down. 'There is a legend Megan, of a silvery-white horse. Some people say it is a unicorn.'
'A unicorn!' I said. 'Maybe the horse I saw was a unicorn. It was a long way away and it was difficult to see. What does the legend say?'
'I don't know.' Uncle Fraser put a big bowl of porridge on the table. 'A shepherd saw the unicorn, but it was a hundred years ago now.'
This was exciting news. 'Who can tell us about the unicorn?'
My uncle poured me a glass of fresh milk. 'Old Mrs McTagerty knows the legend. She's the old woman who lives on the other side of the village. We can ask her. Now eat your breakfast and no more questions!'
The porridge was delicious and I ate it with cream and sugar. The cat came and sat next to me.

Darryl had been a student at the kids' school. He'd been the first member of the archeology club. He was very interested in history and science and he had many books about these subjects. He didn't work in an office or a factory. But he often delivered things for people in his old van. He earned some money that way.

'Well, who can explain what happened yesterday?' Jack asked.
'I have an idea,' Darryl said. 'Some scientists have a theory which could explain it. It's the Psychic Stain Theory.'
'What's that?' Tom asked quickly.
'Well, sometimes a terrible thing happens and it leaves a mark in time,' Darryl replied. 'The mark never disappears. It's like a stain that never fades. Then the terrible thing is repeated for ever and ever. The theory could be correct. Lots of people believe in ghosts. Perhaps ghosts are Psychic Stains too.'
'So that crash did happen. But it didn't happen yesterday. Is that what you think, Darryl?' Jack asked.

'Ooooooh,' everyone said as Otto fitted the arms onto his back. 'It's not possible to control the fusion reaction with my hands. So I use these metal ones. I control them with my brain,' he explained.
'Dr Octavius' asked one of the visitors, 'is there a danger the arms can control you?'
'Good question,' said Otto. 'My brain is safe because of this microchip at the back of my head.' He turned and showed them. 'I control the arms,' he said. 'They don't control me.'
Otto walked to the back of the room. Blue lights went on and there was Otto's fusion reactor. The metal arms moved. They lifted up a very small piece of tritium. 'There are less than twelve kilos of tritium in the world,' he explained. 'I want to thank Harry Osborn and OsCorp for giving me this tritium.'
'Happy to pay the bills, Otto,' called Harry.
Otto turned to smile at his wife, Rosie. This was his big moment! He started the reaction. The tritium started to go round very fast. Suddenly it changed into a small ball of fire. It started to grow. The light was very strong. The visitors couldn't believe it. The energy of the sun was in the room in front of them.

"The moon itself doesn't emit any light like the sun. What we see when we see the moon is sunlight reflected off the moon. The phase of the moon is how much of the moon appears to us on Earth to be lit up by the sun. Half of the moon is always lit up by the sun, except during an eclipse, but we only see a portion that's lit up. This is the phase of the moon. 

Around once per month, every 29.53 days to be exact, the moon orbits around the Earth. As the moon circles the Earth, we can only see a portion of the lit up side. When we can see 100% of the lit up side, this is a full moon. When we can't see any of the lit up side, this is called a dark moon or new moon. 

As the moon orbits or circles the Earth, the phase changes. We'll start with what is called the New Moon phase. This is where we can't see any of the lit up side of the moon. The moon is between us and the sun . As the moon orbits the Earth we can see more and more of the lit up side until finally the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun and we get a full moon. As the moon continues to orbit the Earth we now see less and less of the lit up side. 

As the New moon begins its orbit and we see more and more of the moon, this is called Waxing. After the moon gets to its Full phase, we start to see less and less of the moon. This is called Waning.

"Mma Precious Ramotswe had a detective agency in Africa, at the foot of Kgale Hill. She was the only lady private detective in Botswana, and her agency was the best. So she called it the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.
Mma Ramotswe was a good detective and a good woman. She loved her country, Botswana, and she loved Africa too. The people of Africa were her people, her brothers and sisters. She wanted to help them solve the mysteries in their lives, so she became a private detective.
The detective agency was in a small building in the town of Gaborone. Outside the building was a sign:
THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY.
FOR ALL PRIVATE BUSINESS.
The agency had a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs and an old typewriter. There was also a teapot, and three large cups - one for Mma Ramotswe, one for her secretary and one for the client.
In front of the agency was a tree. When Mma Ramotswe was not busy, she loved to sit under this tree. It was a very good place to think. She could look across the dusty road to the town and, far away, she could see the blue hills. Hills in Botswana always looked blue in the heat.
Mma Ramotswe thought about many things while she was sitting under the tree. She thought about her father, and the beginning of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.
Mma Ramotswe's father worked in the mines in South Africa for fifteen years. The mines were very dangerous. Rocks fell and killed men. The dust destroyed their health.

"Maybe he was mad. Maybe he had a sixth sense. Or was he really haunted? He told me the first part of the story, and I saw the last part with my own eyes.
At school my friend Haldane and I hated a boy called Visger. When we did something wrong, he always told the teacher. One day we stole some cherries from a tree.
'Do you know who did it, Visger?' the teacher asked. 'It was Haldane and Winston,' he replied. Later, Haldane asked him how he knew it was us. 'I didn't know,' he said. 'I just felt certain. And I was right.' Haldane and I grew up. Visger became a vegetarian and never drank alcohol. He also became Sir George Visger.
When we all left Oxford University, I went away to India. After a year I came back and wanted to see Haldane. He was always happy, kind, and honest. I wanted to see the smile in his blue eyes again and hear his happy laugh, so I went to visit him in London. But this time he did not laugh. He was miserable, his face was pale and he looked weak and ill.
He was packing his things, and there were lots of big boxes full of furniture and books around the house.
'I'm moving,' he said. I don't like this house. There's something strange about it; I'm going tomorrow.'
'Let's go out and have some dinner,' I said.
'I'm too busy.' He looked nervously around the room. 'Look, I'm really happy to see you, but... Why don't you go to the restaurant and bring back some food?'
When I came back, we sat by the fire and ate the food. I tried to tell jokes and he tried to laugh, but sometimes he looked into the shadows in the corners of the room. We finished our meal, and then I said, 'Well?'

"Sharks
 Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well, and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. 
Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, most sharks ought to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

"New TV Star

Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role

'I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I’d only ever acted at school, but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her.
I'd taken a year off to go travelling before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me to say there were plans to turn the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to go for the part. She was surprised at first, but sent my photograph to the director and persuaded him to meet me. I flew back and got the part.
The outdoor filming started a week into term, so I got permission from the university to be away for three weeks. Once I was back at university, I got up at 6.00am to write the essays I'd missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great.
It was an amazing experience I'm so lucky. After university, I definitely want to make acting my career. I’m not from an acting family, though my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV parts but haven't received any offers yet.
I don't know how I managed it all, because I had a full social life too. When filming finished, I hardly knew what to do. I've since appeared in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven't been home much and now my first year at university is over, I'm off to Greece for the summer with friends.'",B1
"Anna’s new school 

It’s been a very exciting week, as we’ve just moved into our new school building! It’s an amazing place, as the builders have used wood for the whole thing, just like in our old school, but it’s also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. 
The school took months to build, so we saw it all happening. It was really exciting seeing the builders clear the space where it would be, although it also meant that some lovely open land disappeared. And the noise of the building machines was really loud, although the builders often had to stop work because it rained so hard. We all began to think the building would never be finished. 
We have five classrooms now, which are enormous – much bigger than in our previous school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town when they want to have meetings and so on. There’s a nursery too, a lovely dining room, and really big changing rooms which we’re looking forward to using as soon as our new sports field is ready. 
When you come into the school, one of the first things you notice is that there aren’t any heaters in the building! Instead, the heat for the school comes from all of us inside it – the children, the teachers and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it holds all the heat inside – and all the sound too, so if we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we’re inside a concert hall! 
Another thing you’ll notice is that the school roof has a tree on top of it! It was put there by the builders once they’d finished the roof, because they said it was the custom in Austria, the country where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. It’s so big, it can be seen for miles! We took some pictures which we’re planning to put on the website. 
Even though we’re already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it – for example, at the moment we’re putting on a play for parents to come and see, but we still have to walk back to our old school hall to do it. The replacement will be ready by next year, though. We’re so pleased with our new school, and our teachers say we’ll all learn much faster now we’re in it!

"JAZZ 

By Katie Atkins, aged 14 

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools – and our band won! 
Each band had their own costumes, ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore, to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn’t look much like adult professional bands, but all of us were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially considering everyone was so young. Players from each band even created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch – but even better when my band played on stage! 
We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted – only about half, in fact. But anyone who’s keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country – I’ve been to a couple and learnt a lot. 
Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it’s both new and old at the same time – you can create your own music, but you also feel you’re part of its history, as you’re playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you. 
My school’s really lucky because we have great teachers, and parents who’ve supported us all the way. Without them, we’d never get anywhere with our music!

"She didn't want to come, Steve,' said Carol. 'And now she says that she can see ghosts.' She looked out of the window on to the war memorial in the village square. Everything was silent. Her new husband called it 'a dusty French silence'. Carol called it a dusty hot French silence. It was only April, but it was almost too hot to move.
'I've tried very hard,' Carol continued. 'But she refuses to be my friend.'
'Ghosts?' asked Steve. He was here to rest after a heart attack. Already he was tired of healthy food, no long walks, no heavy drinking and no smoking.
'What sort of ghosts?'
'Oh, I didn't ask,' said Carol. 'Ghosts are ghosts.'
'We'll just have to be patient with her,' replied Steve.
'But it's three years since her mother left you.'
Steve answered her with a sad smile. 'Perhaps Elise isn't happy with you. But that doesn't mean that she's happy with her Mum. Things will get better.'
'You always say that,' said Carol. 'The girl hates me.'
'She's sixteen, Carol,' Steve said, 'She's unhappy. You're new in our lives, and she's not sure about you.'
'When I look at her, she jumps,' said Carol. 'When I come into the room, she leaves it.'
It was very nice to be in love, Carol decided. But it was different being married and a stepmother. She picked up her bag of drawing and painting things.
'I'm going out to paint.'
Steve smiled at her. 'Don't get too friendly with any ghosts!' He tried to put his arm round her, but she pushed him away.

"It was lunchtime. I'd been in the Jolly Sailor pub in west London for about half an hour, when I saw a man sitting by himself in a corner of the room. Although I didn't know his name I was sure I knew him from somewhere. He had grey hair and he was looking out of the window at the River Thames.
I don't usually go to the pub at lunchtime, but it was the birthday of one of the other journalists at work. There were four of us. I asked them if they knew the man sitting in the corner. They looked over, but no-one knew him. I don't know why, but I just kept looking at him, trying to remember.
Finally, when we were all about to go back to work, the man turned round and looked straight at me. He knew me, I could see, because he smiled at me. Who was he? Then I realised it was someone I had been at university with five years ago. I couldn't remember his name immediately. He looked so old. He started to get up from his chair and I walked over to him. As I got closer I remembered his name.
'Carl,' I said, 'good to see you. What are you doing here?' I held out my hand.
'John, what a surprise! It's been such a long time.' He shook my hand and then put both hands on my arms. 'It's good to see you. You know, you're the first person I've seen from university for a long time. Those were good times, weren't they?'
It was clear that Carl was pleased to see me, but he wasn't sure what to say to me. He looked so different from the young, happy student I used to know.

"No Title

A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me, and realised why people love rock-climbing.
My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock- climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we'd done.",B1
"Jennifer looked at the clock on the waiting-room wall. Nearly half-past eight. The light was still on in Doctor Gibson's room. I'm going to be late, she said to herself, why doesn't he hurry up? The evening surgery was always busy on Thursdays but tonight was worse than usual.
She quickly put the newspapers in a cupboard. Then she took off her white coat and locked it in the cupboard too. She was turning off the lights when someone rang the front doorbell. Oh no, not another patient, not at this hour. She ran to the door and opened it. Outside it was dark but she could see a man, his hands deep in his pockets. He moved his head and the light fell on his face.
'Richard!' she cried in surprise. 'What are you doing here?'
'Can I come in for a minute?'
He did not wait for an answer but pushed past her and went inside. Jennifer turned to him. She was usually pleased when Richard called, but this was the wrong time. 'I'm sorry, but you can't stay. I must hurry. I'm meeting my friend Claire for dinner and...' She stopped. It was Richard's eyes - they looked tired and worried.
'What's the matter?' she asked.
Just then Dr Gibson called from his room. 'Did I hear the doorbell, Nurse? Was it another patient?'
'No, it's only my brother Richard,' she called back.
She turned back to Richard. 'Is something wrong?' she asked again.
He shook his head. 'I'm fine,' he said. 'It's just... well, I had some trouble at work.'

"The first years of Arthur's reign were very difficult ones. There were many kings who did not want England to be a united country. They fought bitterly against Arthur. Slowly, however, Arthur's power increased. People began to see that he was a good king.
There were always many visitors to Arthur's court because people were keen to meet the young king. One day he received a visit from a queen, Morgan le Fay. She was a beautiful woman and Arthur fell in love with her. She, too, fell in love with him. Arthur was sad when Morgan le Fay's visit came to an end.
One day he was sitting by himself when Merlin approached. Merlin was disguised as a small boy.
'Why are you sad?' the boy asked.
'I have reasons for being sad,' the king replied.
'I know your reasons,' the boy said sharply. 'I know all your thoughts. I also know that you are the son of Igraine and Uther Pendragon.'
Arthur looked at the boy in surprise.
'You're wrong,' he told him. 'What makes you think that?'
'I told you,' the boy replied. 'I know more about you than anyone else.'
'I don't believe you,' Arthur said angrily.
Merlin walked away from Arthur and came back a little while later disguised as an old man.
'Why are you sad?' the old man asked the king.
'I have many reasons for being sad,' Arthur replied, 'and a boy has just been here telling me very strange things.'
'The boy told you the truth,' the old man said.
Arthur looked at the old man in surprise.

"But he was lucky. He saw nobody, and nobody saw him. He walked quickly out of the ward and out of the hospital. Outside, he saw that one of the nurses had left her bicycle against the wall. Howard stared at it. He had a strange feeling that he had done all this before. Somehow, a bicycle was important. But why? He couldn't remember. But he knew he could ride a bicycle. He shook himself, got on the bicycle and rode away quickly.
Somehow he knew the way. It was like having a map in his head. There was Primrose Avenue, and there, yes, there was the big old house. It was hidden behind trees.
Howard started to walk up the drive. It was like the dream. He knew the way exactly. He was certain the answers were here, the answers to all of his questions.
Suddenly, he jumped into the shadow of the trees and stood very still under the branches. He could hear voices. He looked out slowly and saw a van, a white van. It was parked outside the house. Two people were standing by it. They were talking. They were wearing dark uniforms. Then he saw who they were. The police! Of course! A woman had been murdered in this house, and the police were guarding it. He had to be more careful. He had to go round to the back of the house. Nobody would be able to see him there. He crept through the trees silently. He stayed in the shadows.
Again, he knew the way. Here was the back of the house and here was the drainpipe beside the balcony. He climbed up easily and opened the window.

"A dog barked and the dancers stopped. They went to the man, and kissed his hand.
'Come! Let's pray,' the witch said softly. The fisherman wanted to do this, and he followed her. But when he came near the man, he called God's name.
When he did this, the witches screamed and went away. A horse came and the man got on it. He looked at the fisherman sadly, and then disappeared.
The witch with red hair tried to fly away too, but the fisherman stopped her.
'Let me go,' she cried. 'You must not say God's name.'
'No,' he answered, 'You are my prisoner. Tell me the secret now.'
'What secret?' said the witch. She tried to escape.
'You know,' he answered.
She began to cry and said to the fisherman, 'Ask me anything, but not that!'
He laughed, and didn't want to release her.
She could not escape and so she said, 'I am as beautiful as the mermaids,' and she put her face near his.
But he pushed her away and said, 'I will kill you. You must tell me the secret now.'
She trembled. 'All right,' she said. 'It is your soul, not mine.'
She gave him a little knife.
'Why did you give me this knife?' he asked.
She was silent for a moment. She was terrified. Then she said to him, 'Our shadow is not the shadow of our bodies. It is the body of our souls. Stand on the beach with your back to the moon. Cut your shadow from your feet. Then you must tell your soul to leave and it will leave.'

"Hi, Dad. Your supper's in the kitchen.'
John's sixteen-year-old daughter, Christine, was sitting at the table doing her homework. His son Andrew, who was thirteen, was watching television.
'Thanks, Christine,' John said. 'I'm sorry I'm late. Is everything OK?'
'Fine, thanks.' Christine gave him a quick smile, then got on with her work. John got his food from the kitchen, Fried fish and chips. The food was dry and didn't taste very good. But he didn't say anything about that. John was not a good cook himself and his children were no better. His wife had been a good cook, he remembered.
John tried to eat the terrible supper and looked around the small, miserable flat. The furniture was twenty years old, the wallpaper and carpets were cheap and dirty. The rooms were all small, and he could see no trees or gardens from the windows - just the lights from hundreds of other flats. And there were books, clothes, and newspapers on the floor.
Once, when his wife had been alive, he had had a fine house. A beautiful big house in the country, with a large garden. They had had lots of new furniture, two cars, expensive holidays - everything they needed. He had had a good job. They hadn't needed to think about money. And then he had started the boat-building company, and his luck had ended.
When Rachel had died, John had been terribly unhappy - much too unhappy to think about business. A few months later his company had closed, and he had lost all his money. John had had to sell his beautiful house in the country, and move to this miserable flat.

"Harminda looked at her watch and then at the traffic outside. The airport was 10 kilometres away and it was already 5.15 p.m.
'Isn't there a quicker way to get to the airport? My plane leaves in less than two hours,' she asked the taxi driver.
'Are you going home for Christmas?' he smiled. The taxi was full of decorations; there was green tinsel on the steering wheel and mistletoe under the mirror.
'Yes...' said Harminda. But there was no Christmas spirit in her voice.
Harminda looked out of the window, trying not to cry. She remembered the phone call from her Mum earlier that day. She missed her parents so much.
Their argument, four years ago, seemed stupid now. Thirty minutes later, they arrived at Galway airport.
'How much is it?' she asked.
'Fifteen euros for you, sweetheart,' said the taxi driver with a smile.
Harminda gave him a twenty-euro note and got quickly out of the taxi.
'Don't forget your change...' shouted the taxi driver, with a five-euro note in his hand, but Harminda was already inside the airport terminal.

"Mr Duncan? Come in please. Mr Wilson will see you now.'
'Thank you.' John Duncan stood up and walked nervously towards the door. He was a tall, thin man, about forty-five years old, in an old grey suit. It was his best suit, but it was ten years old now. He had grey hair and glasses. His face looked sad and tired.
Inside the room, a man stood up to welcome him. 'Mr Duncan? Pleased to meet you. My name's David Wilson. This is one of our chemists, Mary Carter.'
John Duncan shook hands with both of them, and sat down. It was a big office, with a thick carpet on the floor and beautiful pictures on the walls. David Wilson was a young man, in an expensive black suit. He had a big gold ring on one finger. He smiled at John.
'I asked Miss Carter to come because she's one of our best chemists. She discovered our wonderful new paint, in fact. When... I mean, if you come to work here, you will work with her.'
'Oh, I see.' John looked at Mary. She was older than Wilson - about thirty-five, perhaps - with short brown hair, and a pretty, friendly face. She was wearing a white coat with a lot of pens in the top pocket. She smiled at him kindly, but John felt miserable.
I'll never get this job, he thought. I'm too old! Employers want younger people these days.
David Wilson was looking at some papers. 'Now, Mr Duncan,' he said, 'I see that you are a very good biologist. You worked at a university... and then for two very famous US companies. But... you stopped working as a biologist nine years ago. Why was that?'

"Rock Band

Two years ago,our 14-year-old s on,Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first,we were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued ,’and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.’
That was just the beginning. Because drums are not the easiest instrument to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. And so, for several hours a week,the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.
At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band start practising, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all I didn't expect my parents’ generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenage - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people.
Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet. I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.",B1
"MONEY 

What is money? The pound, the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book, a huge bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is only a printed piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, Mr Green the farmer exchanged the com he had grown for Mr Hive's honey. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. The different currencies began to join together, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.

"At the beginning, all telephone connections were made by operators in the exchange, and this gave acceptable employment to women. After 1899, it was possible to connect using numbers on the phone, but the women were paid very little and their bosses saw no reason to change in a hurry. The Bell Company didn't use the new system until after the First World War.
The first international telephone line connected Paris and Brussels in 1887. By 1900, international services were being connected as well as local ones. This meant putting more wires under the ocean. Britain was connected to the continent of Europe in 1891. 
Although existing telegraph wires could be used, long-distance telephones needed stations to make the sound stronger along the line. New York wasn't connected to San Francisco until 1915. A radio connection between London and New York was made in 1927, although this depended on weather conditions. Similar connections were made to Australia and South America in 1930, and from that time the telephone was truly a world service, although it was expensive. Connections using wire took longer; the first one across the Atlantic Ocean wasn't in place until 1956.
The telephone didn't become common in private houses until the 1920s and even then, only for the middle and upper classes. Since that time, it has reached everybody in the world's richer countries. People used to have one phone in the hall, for use on important occasions, but many now have phones in the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom-even, in some houses, the bathroom.

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976 my only object was to earn enough to feed my children. Today 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all around the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot. Much of what I have learned will be found in this book, for I believe that we, as a company, have something worth saying about how to run a successful business without giving up what we really believe in.
It's not a normal business book, nor is it just about my life. The message is that to succeed in business you have to be different. Business can be fun, a business can be run with love and it can do good. In business, as in life, I need to enjoy myself, to have a feeling of family and to feel excited by the unexpected. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.
Now this book sends these ideas of mine out into the world, makes them public. I'd like to think there are no limits to our 'family', no limits to what can be done. I find that an exciting thought. I hope you do, too.

"San Francisco 

San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. 
He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly, although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. 
In 1849, people arrived in San Francisco in their thousands hoping to find gold. However, it was not the men looking for the gold that got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. 
Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

"The man in front of me was tall and strong, with thick dark hair. He sat in an expensive chair behind an expensive desk, and looked at me with cold grey eyes. He didn't have time to smile.
'OK, Marlowe,' he said. 'So you're a private detective. One of the best in Los Angeles, I hear. I have a job for you. I want you to find my wife. Think you can do that?'
I sat back in my chair and lit a cigarette slowly.
'Yes, Mr Kingsley,' I said. 'I think I can do that.'
'How much?'
'Twenty-five dollars a day. Half a dollar a mile for my car. And a hundred in my hand now, before I do anything.'
He looked at me, and I looked back at him and waited.
Then he smiled. 'OK, Marlowe, you've got the job. But don't talk about it to the police. I have an important job here.' He looked round his quiet, expensive office. The hot July sun didn't get into this room. 'I want to stay in this job, and I can't have any trouble with the police.'
'Is your wife in trouble?' I asked.
'I don't know. Perhaps. She sometimes does very stupid things, and she has dangerous friends.'
He gave me a drink and told me the story. 'I have a house in the mountains, near Puma Point. Crystal went up there in May. She often meets her men friends up there.' He looked at me. 'She has a lot of men friends... you understand? But there was an important dinner down here on June 12th, and Crystal didn't come back for it.'

"On October 31 everybody in Halloweentown was excited.
Halloween night was the most important night of their year and they were all afraid. Dead people came up from under the ground. Thirsty vampires happily drank a lot of blood. Ugly old witches changed some people into cats and other people into fish. Everybody ran from the skeletons, from the sound of their long, thin arms and legs. Black cats jumped in and out of trash cans. Black birds flew through the dark sky with loud, high cries. And Jack Skellington sang his scary songs and danced his dangerous dances. People screamed. They were afraid. They loved it.
At the end of the Halloween night, everybody went to the center of town. The Mayor of Halloweentown stood in front of them and spoke.
""Tonight was the best Halloween party in many years, and the hard work of one man made it possible,"" he said. He turned to the towns greatest skeleton. ""Jack - thank you.""
""It was great, Jack!"" people shouted. ""We loved it! It was wild!""
""Yes,"" the Mayor said. ""We all enjoy Jack's scary songs and dangerous dances. Jack, you're the scariest skeleton in Halloweentown! Thank you for these wonderful celebrations...
""No problem,"" Jack said.
But Jack wasn't happy. Every year he repeated the same songs and dances and he was bored with Halloween. Of course, he couldn't tell anybody. How could he? The people of the town loved him and they waited all year for this night.

"Baloo, the old brown bear, loved teaching Mowgli. He taught him how to speak to the different Jungle-People, and he taught him the important Master-Words. But Mowgli sometimes got bored with all the lessons. One day, when he was not listening, Baloo hit him, very softly, on the head, and Mowgli ran away angrily.
Bagheera, the black panther, was not happy about this. 'Remember how small he is,' he said to Baloo. 'How can his little head hold all your long words?'
'These words will keep him safe from the birds, from the Snake-People, and all the animals that hunt,' said Baloo. 'It is true that he is only small. But no one will hurt him, if he remembers all the Master-Words. Come, Mowgli!' he called into the trees. 'Come and say the words again.'
Mowgli climbed down from a tree and came to sit next to them. 'I will say the words to Bagheera, not you, fat old Baloo!' he said crossly.
'Very well,' said Baloo sadly. 'Say the words for the Hunting-People.'
'We are of one blood, you and I,' said Mowgli.
'Good. Now for the birds.'
Mowgli said the same words but with the sound of a bird.
'Now for the Snake-People,' said Baloo.
Mowgli then made the long 'ssss' sound, which was like no other noise, only the noise of a snake.
'Good,' said Baloo gently. 'One day you will thank me for my lessons. Now you will be safe in the jungle, because no snake, no bird, no animal will hurt you. You do not need to be afraid of anyone.'

"THE ROCKIES 

The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west, but lie only a few hundred miles from the 
centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are no less wonderful. 
There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, the most attractive of Canada's big cities. Standing with its feet in the water and its head in the mountains, this city allows its residents to ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city centre. 
Thirty passenger trains a day used to set off from Vancouver on the cross- continent railway. Now there are just three a week, but the ride is still a great adventure. You sleep on board, which is fun, but travel through some of the best scenery at night.

"Late that evening, we saw land far out to sea and the ship turned towards it. We were nearing Montgomery's island.
After supper, Montgomery and I stood outside, talking under the stars. I was interested to know more about his animals and his island home. But he seemed uncomfortable with my questions, so I soon changed the subject. We spoke about London, and about science. But as we talked, my questions grew stronger in my mind. Why was a man of science living on an unknown island in the middle of the Pacific? Why was he taking the puma, rabbits and dogs there? And who was that strange man who worked for him?
I heard a noise behind me and turned. Montgomery's dark assistant was standing a few steps from us. He looked quickly towards me. For a second or two, his eyes shone red in the lights of the ship. It frightened me terribly. I thought of the stories that I read as a child, of monsters and strange animals of the night. Then the man looked away, and Montgomery was saying, 'I'm going to bed now. There'll be lots to do in the morning.'
I followed him down the ladder and went to my room. I slept little that night. I was woken many times, both by the noises of the dogs and by my terrible dreams.
Early the next morning, I woke to a new sound. Someone above me was pushing the animal cages across the ship. I climbed the ladder. At the top, six men were carrying the puma in his cage to the side of the ship. A large man with white hair was now on board, talking to Montgomery.

"Norwich

Norwich, the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia, has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England.
With two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has long been a popular centre for various religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and has recently celebrated its 900th anniversary, while Norwich itself had a year of celebration in 1994 to mark the 800th anniversary of the city receiving a Royal Charter. This allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself independently.
Today, in comparison with places like London or Manchester, Norwich is quite small, with a population of around 150,000, but in the 16th century Norwich was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years and got richer and richer, becoming famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year.
Nowadays, there are far fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964 the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. With its fast-growing student population and its success as a modern commercial centre (Norwich is the biggest centre for insurance services outside London), the city new has a wide choice of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and a number of arts and leisure centres. There is also a football team, whose colours are green and yellow. The team is known as 'The Canaries', though nobody can be sure why.
Now the city's attractions include another important development, a modern shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. The people of Norwich lived with a very large hole in the middle of their city for over two years, as builders dug up the main car park. Lorries moved nearly a million tons of earth so that the roof of the Mall could become a city centre park, with attractive water pools and hundreds of trees. But the local people are really pleased that the old open market remains, right in the heart of the city and next to the new development. Both areas continue to do good business, proving that Norwich has managed to mix the best of the old and the new.",B1

Some people have complained about this year's collection, New Writing 3, although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality, for £6.99, is pretty amazing?
Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers, such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. It's a strange fact that the less well-known people seem to have written mainly about food. Take my advice about Jane Harris' s Those Nails - this piece should definitely not be read just after meals. It contains some very unpleasant scenes which could turn your stomach!
There is fine work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are pieces from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Finally, there is a little non-fiction, which includes a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger on certain newspapers, and an extraordinary piece about herself from Ursula Owen. This is an exceptional collection and I for one can't wait to see what next year's choice will include.",B1
"ZOOS 

People began to keep animals in zoos over 3,000 years ago, when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos, animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. 
Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everybody approves of zoos. People who think that zoos are a good idea say they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals. Both of these would not be possible without zoos. On the other hand, some people disapprove of zoos because they believe it is wrong to put animals in cages, and argue that in zoos which are not managed properly, animals live in dirty conditions and eat unsuitable food.

"Many people in the kingdom did not use the gift of the sky wisely. When they took more than they could eat, the sky became angry. Some people threw the extra pieces into the garbage.
Early one morning the angry sky turned dark. Black clouds hung over the land, and a great sky voice said to all the people, ""You are wasting my gift of food. Do not take more than you can eat. I don’t want to see pieces of me in the garbage anymore or I will take my gift away.""
The king and the people trembled with fear. King Oba said, ""Let’s be careful about how much food we take."" For a long time, all the people were careful.
But one man named Adami wasn’t careful. At festival time, he took so many delicious pieces of sky that he couldn’t eat them all. He knew he must not throw them away.
He tried to give the pieces to his wife. ""Here, wife,"" Adami said. ""You eat the rest.""
""I can’t,"" Adami’s wife said. ""I’m too full.""
Adami asked all his children to help him eat the delicious pieces of sky, but the children couldn’t eat one more bite. So Adami decided to try to hide the pieces at the bottom of the garbage pile.
Suddenly, the sky became angry and the clouds turned black. ""You have wasted my gift of food again,"" yelled the sky. ""This time I will go away so you cannot waste me anymore.""
All of the people cried, ""What will we eat? We might starve!""
The sky said, ""You will have to learn how to plant crops in the ground and hunt in the forests. If you work hard, you may learn not to waste the gifts of nature.""",B1
"People think of Florence Nightingale as the perfect nurse, spending her whole life working with patients. The truth is that she spent only three important years as a nurse. The rest of her career was spent writing letters and working to improve hospitals by using statistical studies.
Florence Nightingale was born in 1820 to a wealthy British family. At that time, young girls were not usually provided a rigorous education. Their only future would be as good wives and mothers. At the age of 16, Florence Nightingale grew tired of sewing and other “female” activities. She begged her family to allow her to get extra tutoring in mathematics.
By age 24, she decided that she wanted to be a nurse. This decision was terrible news to her family. It was widely believed that only poor women with few morals became nurses. There was no training available in England because being a nurse was just an unpleasant, unskilled job. Florence Nightingale, however, did receive some training in France. She then became the superintendent of the nurses at the Hospital for Invalid Gentlewomen in London. She did an excellent job. In 1855 the British Minister of War asked her to help out in a British hospital in Turkey during the Crimean War.
Florence Nightingale agreed to go, and she spent three years in the Crimea. She found the hospital was dirty when she arrived. Many of the soldiers, instead of being cured, died from disease or from dirt in their wounds. She cleaned up the hospital and, by writing angry letters, got better supplies and food from England for the men. Because of her efforts, the death rate at the hospital dropped from 42 percent to 2.2 percent.",B1
"HONEY 

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. In fact, there are more than three hundred varieties of honey. 
The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. 
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. 
Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Research suggests that it prevents tiredness and improves athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care 26 A involves products.

"Easter Island is just a dot in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile. It is a relatively small island with a total area of only 63 square miles. It is volcanic, which is probably why it has no trees. The island is shaped like a boomerang, and each of its three corners has an extinct volcano.
Easter Island was relatively unknown until 1722, when Dutch Admiral Roggeveen arrived with the first Europeans ever to set foot on the island. To their surprise, they were greeted by hundreds of mammoth stone statues lining the shores. To the Europeans, the giant, legless creatures appeared strange indeed. All were “figures of men with short square bodies and strangely oversized heads, many balancing red stone cylinder-like hats on their heads.” They were very similar to one another, each with a large nose and long ears, but they were not identical. Each face was taller than a human being, and many were as tall as a four-story building.
For an early society to have made these enormous figures with only stone tools was an amazing feat in itself. What was even more baffling was how the people moved the creations, some of which weighed many tons. The discovery of a large stone quarry unlocked clues. It was apparent that this was the site where the statues had been carved before being moved to their final resting places. Some statues appeared to be complete, while others were barely started. When work on these statues was suddenly abandoned, some were in the process of being moved. It was obvious that the statue builders had cut down the island’s trees to make rolling logs and wooden scaffolds, which were then used to carry the huge statues from the quarry to the island’s perimeter.",B1

"We went to the park. We knew of fifty-two sons in prison. We made a circle of lights, one for each son. People stopped to look at the dancing lights, and came to ask about our campaign. 
By the time it was dark, our camp had grown to more than fifty women. We built a fire to keep ourselves warm and sang freedom songs. 
Two days passed. On Sunday we held a church service in the park. We put up a big sign, saying 'Freedom Corner'. Many men came to talk to us. Some had been in prison themselves and had suffered terrible treatment there. 
'You see Nyayo House over there,' they told us, and pointed to a government building across the road from the park. 'Underneath that building are rooms where terrible things are done to prisoners. Many have died after their treatment there.' 
We listened as the men told us their experiences. Many of us could not believe our ears. 'These things happened to me ten years ago,' said one man. 'But I have never spoken about them before.' 
By Monday, our numbers had grown to several hundred. The sons did not appear, but the police did. At three in the afternoon, they ran into the camp, hitting people with sticks. Some of the young men in our camp fought back. The sound of gunshots filled the air.

"This is a realistic novel. It’s based on history. Unlike other historical literature, it’s easy to understand. If you already know a lot of information about World War II, this might be an interesting book for you. It’s not recommended if you don’t know too much about the World Wars. In this case, you will be focusing on trying to understand the facts too much so you will not enjoy the book as much.
Plot Summary
This is a story of hope and courage. The year is 1943 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The area has been taken over by Hitler’s army. There are soldiers everywhere. The life of 10-year-old Annemarie has changed a lot. There is little food and everyone is very scared. There is talk about moving all of the Jewish people to another place. This is difficult for Annemarie because her best friend, Ellen, is Jewish.
This is a different book about the war. It shows it was not only the Jewish people who suffered during the war. Annemarie’s family lost their eldest daughter, Lise, a few weeks before her wedding.
Annemarie will later do what her sister, Lise, did. She will join the resistance party to fight against the Nazis. She ends up being a heroine (a female hero) for a few reasons (which I will not tell you because I don’t want to ruin the story).",B1
"Currently, school commences before most people even dream about waking up. I would like to ask that the starting time be changed at our school. Classes at Sebastian Valley Middle School simply start too early in the morning.
In spite of what many people believe, teens and pre-teens need as much sleep as younger children. Getting the recommended eight to nine hours of sleep each night is almost inconceivable when classes begin at 7:30 A.M. In order to shower, dress, get organized, eat a quick breakfast, and meet the school bus by 6:45, I would have to get up at 5:45.
Early in the morning, students are too sleepy to learn well. Sleep is food for the brain. Without sufficient sleep, young people cannot think clearly, complete assignments, or enjoy learning. According to a report entitled “Are Students Getting Enough Sleep?” from a recent edition of Sebastian Valley Times, “sleepiness decreases concentration, reduces short-term memory, and causes bad moods.”
Researchers have learned that teens routinely fall asleep and wake up later than adults. Teens who stay up late at night have trouble getting up early in the morning. Studies show that some schools have already adjusted school hours to better match the teen sleep cycle; consequently, students in these schools are learning better on the new schedule.
To sum up, teens need as much or more sleep than adults, have a later sleep cycle, and learn and behave better when rested. For these reasons, I would like to suggest that we have an assembly to discuss the issue of the school start time and give all students an opportunity to vote.",B1
"Free-diving in the Caribbean

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, the sport in which competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air.
In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath, and come back up to the top without help. She had been deeper a year before but on that occasion she swam back up using a balloon. This time, however, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man. A team of fourteen safety divers at different depths watched the dive.
Following reports of several serious accidents involving other divers, some people have complained that free-diving is too dangerous a sport, but Tanya doesn't agree, insisting that safety is the most important thing, followed closely by training.
Most free-divers concentrate on one or two types of event within the sport, but whatever Tanya is in training for, her practice timetable remains the same. Two thirds of the programme is spent doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart. However, she doesn't run, whether outdoors or on running machines, because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness. When she starts doing practice dives, she generally travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over a four-week period, with a rest day between each diving day. It is essential that she doesn't get tired because that could ruin all the preparation.
When Tanya is not preparing for an event, she makes frequent public appearances, mainly to advertise sports products. She has also supported environmental organisations, for example doing research projects or making films. Spending her childhood on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she went swimming whenever she could, and long afternoons were spent exploring rockpoolsinordertowatchthesealife.Tanyasaysthatherlifetodayislikelivingherchildhood dreams. Because she is well-known in some countries, she thinks people are prepared to listen to her when she is talking about environmental issues.
As for the future, Tanya, who is now in her thirties, says she plans to keep breaking her own world records. As she didn't take up free-diving until she was twenty-five, Tanya is keen to stress that she doesn't intend to retire from the sport for many years to come.",B1
"Grass

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. 
Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. 
Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

"A few days after this, Virginia and her young admirer went out riding in the fields. But a tree tore her riding skirt very badly, and when they got home she went up the back stairs to mend it. She was running past the half-open door of one of the rooms when she saw someone inside. It was, she  thought, her mother's servant, who sometimes took her needlework there. So she went to the door to ask the girl to mend her skirt.
But to her great surprise, it was the Canterville Ghost himself !
He was sitting by the window, watching the first leaves of autumn falling from the trees. His head was on his hand, and he looked terribly unhappy. Little Virginia's first idea was to run away and lock herself in her room, but then she began to feel sorry for him. He didn't know she was there until she spoke to him.
' I'm so sorry for you,' she said. ' But my brothers are going back to school tomorrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy you.'
The ghost looked round in surprise at the pretty little girl who was daring to speak to him. ' It's silly to ask me to behave myself,' he answered. 'Very silly.'
'Why ? ' she said.
' Because I have to make noises with my chains, and cry through keyholes, and walk about at night,' said the Canterville Ghost. ' It's my only reason for being alive.'
' That's no reason for being alive, and you know you've been very bad,' said Virginia.

"Islands are areas of land that are not connected to a continent and are surrounded by water. Small islands are sometimes called cays, keys, or islets. A group of islands is often called an archipelago. 

There are two main type of islands: continental islands and oceanic islands. 

Continental islands are part of a continental shelf. One example of this is Great Britain is an island that sits on the continental shelf of Europe. 

Oceanic islands are islands that don't sit on a continental shelf. Many oceanic islands are formed by undersea volcanoes like Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. 

Greenland is by far the world's largest island that is not a continent. It covers 822,706 square miles which is more than double the second largest island, New Guinea. For such a large island, Greenland only has a population of around 56,000 people making it one of the least densely populated places in the world.
 
Great Britain is the ninth largest island in the world and is the largest island in the British Isles. It is the third most populated island in the world. The British Empire was centered here and at its peak in the 18th to 20th century was the largest empire in the history of the world. 

Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world. It's located off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to many animal and plant species that can't be found anywhere else on the planet.

The average flight is 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, Antarctica experts who have lived on scientific research stations there give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera next to the pilot, which is linked to the video system on board, gives you a pilot's eye view throughout, from take-off to landing.
Will I get a seat next to a window?
All passengers are given two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, passengers are asked to move to the seat shown on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a next-to-window seat for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or the seat next to a window seat for half of the flight and an end of row seat for the other half of the flight. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up from their seats and move about the plane, allowing everyone to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow these amazing sights to be seen equally well from both sides of the plane.
What happens if the weather is bad?
We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain looks at the satellite cloud picture on the morning of the flight and selects the direction which promises the clearest views.
Will I see penguins and other wildlife?
As most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 metres below the plane, we can't see them in any detail. We do not land on Antarctica, primarily for environmental reasons. To experience Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.
Can I take photographs?
Definitely! All cameras are welcome. We even provide a few fun onboard photo opportunities where you can experience what it is like to wear Antarctic cold weather clothes.",B1
"Shopping for furniture 

A report by Dave Worthington 

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop’s normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced that it wouldn’t close at all for the first 24 hours. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: ‘The police had been informed that a large crowd was expected but people just weren’t patient. The shop was soon full and the managers sensibly decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and they refused to queue quietly until there was space for them inside. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What I really couldn’t believe was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. This meant that the road was then completely blocked.’ 
One customer, Jenny Smith, who managed to get into the shop, said: ‘I queued for three hours and I didn’t have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They didn’t have any choice, as it wasn’t safe. So I’ll come back when they reopen but I’m not willing to queue again.’

"I walked to the Ministry of the Interior. I waited in another queue. I spoke to another official. I asked for an Identity Card.
'Fill in this application form,' the official said. 'And bring the form and three photographs of yourself and two dollars. Come back tomorrow.'
'Tomorrow?' I said. 'Can I have an Identity Card today, please? I live in Minta. I live five hours' journey from Darpur. I'm an old man.'
'Yes, come back tomorrow.' And the official turned away.
I walked away from the Ministry of the Interior. I walked to the market. At the market I looked at everyone. I was looking for a man from my village. But I could not find a villager. So then I walked to the shop of Rick. I spoke to Rick.
'I want an Identity Card,' I told him. 'But I need three photographs of myself.'
'I see. You need some photographs.' And he showed me the way to a photographer.
I found the house. The photographer was asleep but he came to me quickly. The man's clothes were dirty and he looked tired.
'I need an Identity Card,' I said. 'I want three photographs of myself.'
'Yes, you want three photographs of yourself,' the photographer replied. 'And I take very good photographs. Come and see my camera.'
We walked into his room. In the middle of the room was a large camera.
'This is the best camera in Darpur. This camera is very, very good,' the photographer said proudly.
'I've never seen a camera,' I said. 'I don't know about cameras. Hurry up and take a photograph of me.'

"When Elizabeth I dies, her third cousin, James VI of Scotland, becomes also King James I of England.
He announces plans to unite his two realms but faces strong opposition both north and south of the border. Although James is a Protestant he is the son of the late Catholic, Mary Queen of Scots. Catholics are hopeful that her son will be more sympathetic to their plight.
On the 25th July 1603, King James VI of Scotland arrived in London to be crowned King James I of England.
His journey from Edinburgh had taken over a month, and he entered the capital at the head of a triumphal procession to huge crowds.
He had already been king of Scotland for 35 years, but now that Elizabeth I had died James had just become king of England, Wales and Ireland.
James became king of Scotland when he was just thirteen months old.
From birth, James had one of the strongest claims to the English throne thanks to his great-grandmother Margaret Tudor, the granddaughter of Elizabeth Woodville, The White Queen.
Margaret had been the sister of Henry VIII of England and aunt to Elizabeth I. There were now so few Tudors that her cousin James VI was her closest heir.
At his baptism at Stirling castle the Scots hailed him around a specially ordered round table as ""Little Arthur,"" the future king of a united Britain, just like King Arthur of legend.

"One of the great things about digital technology is that we don’t have to sit around and talk about the possibilities - we can see them in action.
Every day ordinary people use the digital world to get their voices heard and really make a difference. And it couldn’t be easier. Right now anyone could go online sign a petition to save an ancient forest; start an anti-sexism campaign; or even message the Prime Minister and tell him what they think of his policies.
So what can I do? What can you do? During making this iWonder piece I’ve discovered some of the issues that people in the UK really care about and I’ve learnt about successful online campaigns like e-petitions. If I’ve got something to say where do I start?
Getting your voice heard is the starting point to getting things changed. For example, if I wanted to post this iWonder guide right now with one click it goes out to 75, 000 people. If someone else shares it then it just gets bigger and it will be shared more and more and more – that’s how you get your voice out.
Eight hundred years ago it was very different. In 1215 it took some of the richest, most powerful men to get King John to agree to the Magna Carta. Today any one of us can seek change. Readily available technology has made it easier than ever before.",B1
"I phoned Susan immediately. I told her that I was going to London.
'You're not going on your own,' she told me. 'I don't want you to have another accident. I'm coming too.'
Susan was right. It was better not to go alone. 'OK,' I said. 'Meet me at the station as soon as you can.'
About twenty minutes later, Susan had bought our tickets and we were on the train to London. On the journey, I told Susan about the twenty thousand pounds and the diamonds.
Susan wasn't pleased. 'Why did you want to pay for the diamonds in cash?' she said. 'Isn't it safer to pay by cheque'? Or can't your bank pay the money into the account of the diamond dealer? You don't need to use cash, do you?'
'I don't often buy expensive diamonds,' I explained. 'And when I do I don't usually pay for them in cash. But sometimes cash is better than a cheque.'
'I don't understand,' said Susan.
'If you pay in cash, you can often get a better deal"" you pay a lot less,' I explained.
Susan shook her head. 'I don't like you doing that, James. It's very stupid to pay in cash. Twenty thousand pounds is a lot of money. Now the diamonds have been stolen. There is no record of the sale. You have lost everything. And it's all your own fault. You really have been very stupid, James.'
I felt very stupid. But that didn't help me. Susan and I didn't speak for the rest of the journey. We didn't speak again until we arrived in London at 12.20.

"The tilt of the Earth has two major effects: the angle of the Sun to the earth and length of the days. 

For half of the year the Earth is tilted such that the North Pole is more pointed towards the Sun. For the other half the South Pole is pointed at the Sun. 

When the North Pole is angled toward the Sun, the days on the northern part of the planet (north of the equator) get more sunlight or longer days and shorter nights. With longer days the northern hemisphere heats up and gets summer. 

As the year progresses, the Earth's tilt changes to where the North Pole is pointing away from the Sun, producing winter. For this reason, seasons north of the Equator are the opposite of seasons south of the Equator. When it's winter in Europe and the United States, it will be summer in Brazil and Australia.

We talked about the length of the day changing, but the angle of the Sun changes as well. In summer the sunlight shines more directly on the earth giving more energy to the Earth's surface and heating it up. During the winter the sunlight hits the Earth at an angle. This gives less energy and doesn't heat the Earth as much. 

In the Northern Hemisphere the longest day is on June 21st while the longest night is on December 21st. It's just the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere where the longest day is December 21st and the longest night is June 21st. There are two days a year where the day and night is exactly the same. These are September 22nd and March 21st.

"Henry Ford 

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1,500 kilometres, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T', which sold for $825. He was soon selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice. 'You can have any colour you like,' said Henry Ford of the Model T,'as long as it's black.'

The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends.
Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons.
From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says that her method is not supposed to produce great violinists, and always suggests that pupils who perform particularly well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods.

"Many people use email today to communicate with each other.  If you have access to a computer, it’s a great way to send messages easily, quickly, and as often as you like.  No longer is it necessary to find a pen or paper, not to mention an envelope or a stamp. Are we missing anything by not writing actual letters to people?  Is the experience of receiving such letters worth the trouble of writing them?  Most people would probably reply “No, it was a waste of paper anyway; this is a much better system.”  It’s hard to argueagainst such a logical viewpoint.  However, I would like to try. I believe that the kinds of letters people used to write tended to be more meaningful than the vast majority of the billions of emails sent today.  Of course, when it comes to sending quick messages to convey specific information, email is the best.  If time is important, email is particularly useful.  If, however, you want to really reach out and touch someone, a letter is more personal. Handwritten letters are the most personal.  If you can type fast, you can fit a lot into a letter.  What’s lacking is that special sense of the person that comes from seeing her or his handwriting.  As long as it’s legible, it doesn’t matter how tidy it is.  When someone sits down and writes just for you, you feel that when you’re reading it. Although I’m a teenager, I confess that I too feel thrilled to receive a letter in the mail.  I love seeing my name written by hand on an envelope.  I make myself a nice cup of cocoa or lemonade, sit down in a cozy place, open my letter, and enjoy everything that the person put into words just for me.",B1
"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA,
Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. This town grew so quickly during 1909 that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the summer months, essential supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat, but in the winter the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to them. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners.
The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat for both themselves and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.
However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but, unfortunately, the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot considered skilled enough to manage the flight, was away on a trip at the time. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead.
The trip covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska looking for gold, travelled the first 400 of those kilometres. He had to trust his dog Togo's ability to find his way in the blinding snow and Togo turned out to be a reliable guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point Balto refused to go any further, and saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped and Balto became a hero.
Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.",B1
"THE ICEHOTEL 

For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. In the winter of 1990 the French artist Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the little town of Jukkasjärvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night a group of foreign guests decided it would be a good idea to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The following morning the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today it is world famous. 
As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjärvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed. As the ICEHOTEL is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season, the finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. 
Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than –5 °C to –8 °C, however cold it may be outside. Winter outer clothes such as warm overalls, hats and gloves are included in the cost of guests’ stay at the hotel. In addition to this, it is a good idea for guests to bring sweaters and a scarf as well as plenty of woollen socks and to choose footwear that is larger than normal to allow space for thick socks. 
If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in. 
The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjärvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.

"The History of Shoes 

In the past, importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins, which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on what is in fashion. 
It was only one hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

Tuesday, Becky didn't want to walk. Again Tom said, ""Stay here. I'm going to look for the door."" This time he went to a new place. There was light there. He went to the light. It came from a small door in the cave. Tom went out of the cave. Then he went back to Becky. ""Come with me,"" he said. ""We can go out of the cave now."" Tom and Becky went out of the cave. They were very happy. They went to the river and waited there. Some men in a small boat came to them.

Tell: Why? I talked to him. I didn't hit him.
Hedwig: But he's going to remember you. He's going to make problems for us. Wait and see.

Hedwig: Please do that. Where are Walther and Wilhelm?
Tell: They're in the garden. They're playing a game. Look at them. They're little soldiers.
Hedwig: William, this isn't good. My sons aren't going to be soldiers. I want peace in my country and in my family.
Tell: I understand, Hedwig. Our sons are going to be hunters, but one day our country is going to want soldiers too. At that time, every man, woman and child must fight for Switzerland.
Hedwig: William, can't you go to the Emperor? Can't you and your friends talk to him about peace?

"It was a hot Saturday in early July. The water and sky were blue in the afternoon sun and there were some big waves for the surfers. A lot of them were in the sea. Nick was there, too. He sat on his surfboard and waited for a good wave. A big wave came - Nick started to swim strongly. His board moved quickly with the wave and Nick stood up on it. He was a very  good surfer. 
There were some Australians on the beach. They were there for the surf . . . and for the big surfing competition at the beach in a week's time. One of them was a tall girl with long dark hair - Janelle. She was from Queensland. She watched Nick and then looked at one of the boys with her. Mike smiled. 'He's very good, and that's a strong wave. It'll be difficult to beat him in the competition.' The second boy, Brian, was small with long hair and cold blue eyes. Janelle was his girlfriend.
'We can beat him easily,' Brian said. 'He's only good because he knows the beach here. I can surf well on any beach. I want to catch some waves.' He walked down to the sea. 'I don't want to go in the water now,' Janelle said. 'Let's go and have a drink at the caf,.' Brian sat on his surfboard and watched Nick in the water. 'Mike and Janelle are wrong,' he thought. 'He's not very good.'

"Brian and some other people were with Mike. 'There was some glass on the beach - I didn't see it,' Mike said. 'He's going to the doctor,' Brian said to Janelle. Then he looked at Nick.
'You can go - we don't want you here,' he said. Nick started to answer angrily, but Janelle put her hand on his arm. 'I'm sorry about your foot, Mike,' he said. Mike smiled. 'Thanks, Nick. I know that.' After Mike's accident Brian didn't talk to Nick. Nick was right. That evening his father was not happy. You're asking us for money,' he said. 'Only the money for the plane to Australia, Dad. I have eight hundred pounds in the bank, and I can win the prize money from the competition this weekend  that's a thousand pounds - I'll have one thousand, eight hundred .'I don't know about this, Nick,' his father said. 'I'll talk to your mother about it.'  The day of the surfing competition was hot and sunny. In the morning all the surfers tried to catch the good waves. The judges watched from the beach. Nick and Brian surfed well all morning. Nick did not have time to talk to Janelle in the morning but she waited for him before the afternoon competition. 'You're doing well,' she said. There are only four very good surfers in the competition and you're number two, after Brian. Good luck!'In the afternoon the waves were very big but Nick was a strong swimmer.

Brazil were the champions again, and Pele was very happy for the team. The 1966 World Cup was in England. Pele doesn't like remembering this championship. Usually, Brazil went to the  games with twenty-two players. In England, they had forty-three. This was bad for the

I visited every room on the Nautilus, the first and only submarine in the seas. Captain Nemo was its builder, and he talked about his answers to the problems of an underwater boat. He was a clever scientist and a very interesting man.

"The Maasai are very interesting people. Many live in Kenya, near the Maasai Mara Game Reserve. The men and the women are tall and strong. Every day, they walk across the  country with their cows and their goats.
There is very little grass in the Maasai Mara, and very little rain. The men and boys hunt wild animals and bring them back home. Sometimes, very young boys kill lions. This is dangerous, but for the Maasai it is important.
The Maasai dress in beautiful colours: usually red. They like dancing and singing. Sometimes they sing and dance for visitors at the hotels in the game reserve.
Maasai women don't hunt, but they do a lot of work. They build the houses for their families. The Maasai people move from place to place and the women build new homes in the new places.
Every morning, they get up very early and bring water for their families. This is a very important job because water is a big problem for the Maasai. The women make the food too. The Maasai eat meat and they eat food from plants.
Not all Maasai children go to school. Often there are no schools near their homes. School is expensive too, and many families haven't got the money. Today, many Maasai people live and work in towns. Sometimes they visit their families and friends.

"The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. The way one picture, a single snapshot, could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, a human being, was embedded in my consciousness.
One day, one second, I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera. Finish one, load another, and keep looking, with eyes wide open. That was my code. Had been for a long time.
I’d come close once, when some weird aptness in the knotted shape of a smoke plume from a burning oil well made my picture the one newspapers and magazines all over the world suddenly wanted. Brief glory from an even briefer moment. Just luck, really. But they say you make your own - the bad as well as the good.
I went freelance after that, which should have been a clever move and would probably have worked out that way, but for life beyond the lens taking a few wrong turnings. The mid-nineties weren’t quite the string of triumphs I’d foreseen when my defining image made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I was in Vienna, rather than anywhere even faintly newsworthy.
But, still, I was taking photographs. And I was being paid to do it. It didn’t sound bad to me. The assignment was actually a piece of happenstance. I’d done the London shots for a glossy coffee-table picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, a European co-publishing venture that netted me a juicy commission to hang round moody locations in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I’d given my own particular slant to daffodils in Hyde Park and heat haze and traffic fumes in Piccadilly.
I’d also reconciled myself to the best and truest of what I’d delivered being tossed aside. It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn’t meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.
It was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute’s role.
The Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren’t great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn’t have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.
They put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I’d last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn’t even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.
I knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.
The first day I didn’t even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn’t wanted to.
This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.
Next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn’t figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I’d have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there’s always been something magical about photography.
It certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.
And even when you know why it happens you don’t lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning failed in some strange way to surprise me.",C2

My own ambitions were just as insane as his, I wanted to be a pop star, for all the healthy reasons women, money and fame. The difference between Andrew and myself was that my dreams were never life or death to me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become so had I failed.
Consequently, when Andrew suggested a completely new insane ambition for me, i.e. to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no qualms about giving it a go. This was partly because within ten minutes of our introduction, he was at the piano and had played me three tunes he had composed — I could tell that he was good. Very good.
As he confidently continued to bash out selections from some of the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of many of the best show albums from my parents LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world.
I had little to impress him with in return, other than instant praise for his music and a bona fide, actually released, seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) with which an unknown pop group had dealt the final blow to their moribund career by recording three months previously. We parted, promising to meet again and to write something together. I was still more interested in the charts than in the West End theatre, but told myself on the bus back to my flat that I had just met somebody of rare ability and determination, and I would be mad to miss out on being a sidekick to a chap who was clearly going to take the musical theatre by storm, probably by next week.
And even if the two of us failed to challenge the top musical composers successfully, then we could try to knock the Beatles and Rolling Stones off their perches later, in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would clearly be in need of some new material.
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a solicitor, the brief certainty I had enjoyed of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded somewhat. I would of course continue to keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist, and would turn out a few more three-chord songs tailored not to expose the limitations of my voice, but it was still odds-on that eventually I would stagger through my exams and wind up a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five.
By then I would have surely grown out of pop music as my father had confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying - if he was right I only had a few more months of enjoying it.
But in the meantime I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go and see a musical with him, to write words that aped musical lyricists rather than pop stars. And Andrew was a fascinating individual who talked of Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team.
I wasn’t convinced by the idea for a musical that he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was beyond question and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room.
The idea was the life of Dr Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was a worthy one indeed, but not one that truly fired my imagination. The hero was too squeaky-clean, at least in Andrew’s version of his life, and the enterprise was unoriginal in both conception and execution, owing far too much to Lionel Bart’s hit show, Oliver.
On the other hand, Andrew’s conviction of his score’s precocious brilliance was infectious and not totally unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, later to be my agent for over a quarter of a century, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there’s a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint.
I set to work with enormous enthusiasm, in particular for those songs that were intended to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes and in many instances gave me the title as well, most of which had presumably been thought up by his ex-wordsmith school pal who had already had a go. I skipped a day at the solicitors office, faking illness, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I did not know it that day but I had changed careers.",C2
"Language

You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability, we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth, they will soon be exchanging words. When there is no one to talk with, people talk to themselves, to their dogs, even to their plants. I like to describe the skill of language as an ‘instinct’. This conveys the idea that people know how to talk in more or less the sense that spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not invented by some unsung spider genius, and does not depend on having had the right education or on having an aptitude for architecture or the construction trades.

Climate and Weather

Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, profoundly affect the lives and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can be a dominating force on the character of landscapes. For example, warmth and wetness all the year round allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are natural treasure troves, with an incredible diversity of species. Conversely cold, windswept areas can muster only a scattered selection of living things. The daily weather patterns that add up in the long term to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing, for the atmosphere is never still. Some of the motion is due to the fact that the envelope of gases rests on a spinning globe, because air is thin it is not dragged along at the same speed as the earth, but tends to lag behind. A more important source of turbulence, or air movement, however, is the sun.

Coffee

My duties as bar-person included serving drinks but, more worryingly, I was to be responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant can stand or fall on its coffee reputation. There followed several days of intensive coffee-making training, in which I took in more than I could ever wish to know about the cleaning and maintenance of the restaurants gleaming espresso machine. I learnt, too, about the essential principles involved in making the perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week I had to admit that making a decent cup of coffee was not as easy as it looked and I fully expected to be banished to lowly ash-tray wiping duties again. Luckily, my boss was a patient man. ‘Making coffee is both an art and a science,' he said, ‘and you need time to acquire the knack.’",C2
"Vancouver

In the last ten years or so, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver, in western Canada. To relax in the evening, residents stroll down the city streets and, if you join them, you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. People come to Vancouver for its mild climate, its wonderful setting between the ocean and the mountains, its clean and safe environment and its educational and job opportunities. And much as some may grumble about the speed at which new buildings have sprung up, there's no doubt that the new arrivals and flourishing tourism industry have helped fuel an urban renaissance. Locals once referred to Vancouver as ‘Terminal City’ because of the city's role as a terminus or gateway to all other places. Though the name has fallen slightly out of favour, Vancouver is more a gateway than ever.

Putting Pen to Paper

Journalists like myself are usually poor letter-writers. I have heard it said that this is because of the instinctive distaste we feel at writing something we are not going to be paid for, but I cannot believe we have quite such mercenary characters. It is more probably that since in our work, we are always striving to get the greatest possible effect, the essential spontaneity of a letter escapes us. The real creative artist, who does not consciously work on the effect at all (though he may rewrite a passage dozens of times), does not have this problem. I believe that it is in this inherent grasp of the effect of his words that there lies the only sure test of the real artist. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines he surely never thought consciously that it was the contrast between polysyllables that made them so effective, as well as showing him to be a great writer.

Supermarket Opening

The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely on a soap star, a disc jockey or a minor member of the royal family to come down and cut the ribbon. Now it seems that new branches are popping up every day in many areas and so the poor old celebrity has become superfluous. Why pay a famous person when any Tom, Dick or Harry will open it for nothing? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new branch of Superbuy, so long as they were at the front. According to one prospective customer who knew someone who worked there, the first five men over the threshold would be getting a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This snippet of information quickly swept through the crowd, instilling feelings of smug superiority among those at the front, and envy from the latecomers.

"Sand

Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete, I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. When you are wet it adheres to you like ‘stucco', and cannot be shifted, even with a fireman’s hose. But, and here’s the strange thing, the moment you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, it pours off you. For days afterwards, you tip mysteriously undiminishing piles of it onto the floor every time you take on your shoes, and spray the vicinity with lots more when you peel off your socks. Sand stays with you for longer than many contagious diseases. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

Lock and Key

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed ever since human beings first built a permanent homestead. The rope-lifted beam behind the door may have given way to an electronic lock triggered by a plastic card with more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, but the urge to shut out the ‘bad guys’ remains. The appeal of a lock and key is, to some extent, psychological. Recently, various companies have experimented with computerised locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a ‘reader’, control electronic locks by means of a digital command. But people don’t like them. You may be prepared to put up with it at work, but at home, everyone wants the reassurance of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure they incorporated a proper metal key into the device.

Modern Art

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery as, like many people, I can make head nor tail of modern art. I know I quite like some of it, furry things in particular, neon light sculptures and massive photographs. Perhaps if I were better informed about it, I’d have an opinion on more things. There again, yours not meant to set about it in a school-essay way. The point is not to grasp art, but to let it communicate with you. This is a splendid idea but one that never worked for me in practice. But this new gallery has tried to give the visitor a genuine insight into the whys and wherefores of the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that set a work in context and actually told you what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these nuggets of information helped me understand.",C2
"Advertising on trial

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic, hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years.
In Britain, it meant in 1991 alone that while gross domestic product (GDP) declined, interest rates remained punitively high, consumer spending on almost everything other than staples fell, more than half a million people lost their jobs, and some 75,000 homes were repossessed.
Every single business in the country was affected, some - the vehicle and building trades - finding themselves 30 per cent down. A lot of people - a lot of companies - in a lot of countries suffered. Of course, advertising people are scarcely unique in losing their jobs in such difficult times, but of all those still in employment, they often feel particularly under pressure.
Seen, as they are, to spearhead efforts to support the bottom line, they suppose themselves to be under close enough scrutiny from their colleagues, let alone their bosses. Moreover, they are also faced with the very considerable problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets. They have been told that less must be more.
And yet, alongside these psychological and financial imperatives lies an almost paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The notion that companies should be making sure they are producing services and goods that their customers want, as opposed to merely what it is convenient for them to provide, is not a new one. Still, it’s scarcely unfair to say that it has been only over the past ten or fifteen years that many companies seem to have put the idea intentionally, rather than fortuitously, into practice.
The consequences have been that marketing activities have at last begun to be given the attention they deserve by management, that these people have acquired a little learning about the subject, and that a few brands have actually begun to be genuinely marketed.
All these things have pleasingly increased the status of marketing people, while simultaneously adding to their burden. Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there’s some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people. It is certainly true that if the 80s was the decade in which advertising never had it so good, the start of the 90s saw the industry enduring its worst downturn for a generation. This was, of course, partly a direct consequence of the economic climate at the time.
However, there was also evidence of more deep-seated change which would not simply be waved away as, and when, economic prospects brightened. The fact was that while this recession naturally caused potential clients to review, reconsider and often cut their budgets at the time, it also made them examine more closely than ever before the economics of advertising.
And, generally, in the absence of concrete, convincing and quantitative evidence to the contrary, they had to conclude that the benefits of advertising might be questionable. At a time when enthusiasm to account for every dollar spent was naturally high, it was simply not clear enough to many client companies exactly what they were getting for the large sums of money they were spending, exactly what return they were seeing on their investment. Advertising - ever a business to excite the suspicions of the sceptic - was, as a consequence, more than ever before on trial.
Thus, client companies almost everywhere took the view of one of their leaders quoted in the British trade magazine Campaign: ‘We want better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, better media placement, better thinking. We aim to ensure we get advertising agencies’ best people on our business and then ensure they are motivated to work their fingers to the bone, producing outstanding work for us.’
Now, while none of this should elicit sympathy for a thoroughly tough business, it does mean that many of those advertising people still in work continue to face precisely the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less. If this is, in itself, sufficiently trying, a number of other factors have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult.
Some of these are a direct consequence of the recession discussed earlier: the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take the sort of risks that are ironically often the essence of good advertising. Other events would have happened irrespective of local or global economic conditions.
These include, for example, the dramatic demographic changes facing much of the West, the burgeoning power of the retailer, the changing needs and desires of consumers, the rise of sponsorship, the increasingly onerous legal restrictions on advertising. And, of course, for some companies there is the new challenge of advertising abroad. Together with the economic situation, it is these matters which have forced many of those responsible for advertising to revisit Lord Leverhulme’s commonplace that: ‘Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don’t know which half.’ Because now more than ever before, the pressure is on to increase the proportion of advertising that works.
It is not terribly surprising that, at the moment, help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available. Generally, companies and the advertising agencies they use have been far too busy simply coping with these circumstances to wish to talk or write about them, while those that have succeeded in keeping their heads above water are often understandably anxious to keep the secrets of their success to themselves.
This means that while conferences and seminars may provide some useful information, the books currently available on advertising, and how to do it, really don't. Those that are available tend to treat the process of producing advertising with too much respect. To give the impression that the work advertising agencies produce is invariably of the highest quality, deeply considered and remarkable value for money, is neither true nor likely to help those employees of the client company who are ultimately responsible.",C2
"Heritage

The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously, we feel connected to our personal heritage usually, we know who and what our grandparents were, and we will have heard stories about how they lived. But, beyond that, there is a wider basic need to learn about our past, in order to help us understand and interpret our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a fundamental desire for continuity - assurance about the past goes a long way to assuring our future. It is through this continuity that we achieve our own place in history, our own immortality.
In the same way that you inherit your genes, you also inherit a culture which has been passed down through many generations. There are aspects of your national heritage that you may not like or condone, but it is yours, and it is reassuring to feel a part of something.
Heritage has a phenomenal amount to teach us and, I would say, is imperative for our well-being. It affects everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link with the past was through the stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But, because Western industrial society broke up communities and families, much of that oral tradition has already been lost. Instead, places and architectural ‘memories' give us clues to our past. It is vitally important to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors’ identity.

The Fens

Some while ago I began a novel, Waterland, in which, though I did not know it then, the landscape of that part of England known as the Pens was to play a major part. Since the novel was published I have often been asked why, as an ignorant and perhaps presumptuous Londoner, I chose to write about a part of the country with which I have no personal connection. The short answer is that I chose the Fens because of their apparent unobtrusiveness — a flat and empty stage on which to set the drama of my book. This, as I learnt, was merely theory. The Fens, once one's imagination has got to grips with them, are neither flat nor empty. What I discovered was that the Fens, while as richly English as any other part of England, are also compellingly and hauntingly strange. It is remarkable that there should still exist in the middle of England a region which most English people find peculiarly foreign, especially when so many other distinctive (and remoter) areas of Britain have been ingested into the nations cultural and literary heritage. The Fens are both empty and brimming, both cultivated and tenaciously wild, apparently 'open' and 'obvious' yet profoundly mysterious.
My own physical researches while writing my novel were in fact not so extensive. I have never been, yet, to Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a writer of fiction I am interested in imagined worlds, and I would much rather hazard an inspired guess at some point of authenticity than go for documentary proof. Yet this very attempt to 'imagine' the Fens has its special logic, for, as the pages of Edward Storey's scholarly book abundantly show, the Fens are, peculiarly, not just a landscape but a state of mind.

Museums

Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this simply meant packing them into display cases, often with wordy labels that made little concession to the lay person. Nowadays, accessibility should demand more than this. Displays can be lively and interesting, making the best use of theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors’ attention and perhaps stimulate emotional response. But museums should be about more than their displays. They should make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. The provision of loan boxes of objects for class teachers is one known example of this and, recently, this principle has been extended by some museums so that similar material is made available for use in treating elderly people who are losing their memory.
Museums concern themselves with ‘artefacts and specimens’ - not replicas. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed - were used - had meaning - at some historical time. This is their great strength, and is what distinguishes them from heritage centres and theme parks, books and CD-ROMs. Museums which rise to the challenge which this distinction implies and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in ‘virtual history’ are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the ‘real thing’ that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.

Architecture and Environment

The desire to preserve things is not new, but now change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. It turns some people into rabid preservationists and it encourages others to think more closely about the nature of towns as we know them today and their future.
It may be quite reasonably argued that the generations who have lived through events such as world wars and the like are more inclined to preservation than their predecessors - anything which expresses stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it.
Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it. Physical change, in other words, change in the environment provided by our towns, reflects social change - change in our numbers, in our welfare and in our demands.",C2
"Clutter

Sometimes it seems that no matter how many possessions you have, you never feel secure. While it is reasonable to have a basic nesting instinct and create a home which meets your needs, there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Modern advertising is moreover deliberately designed to play on our insecurities.If you don’t have one of these you will be a lesser human being is one of the consistent underlying messages we receive. To discover just how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street. These multi-million dollar messages relentlessly condition us in very persuasive ways without our ever realising it. We are bombarded by them - television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, tee shirts, the internet, you name it - all encouraging us to buy, buy, buy.

Caves

Research establishments and university departments around the world have invested years of research time in all aspects of caves, mainly their origins, their hydrology and their biology. Caves constitute a small but rather mysterious component of the natural environment - as such they arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge, and consequently have had a considerable amount of research effort devoted to them. Furthermore, because of their presence as natural phenomena, they have had a long history of study, which has been intensified in those parts of the world where caves have had a direct effect on our way of life. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields. Indeed there is a considerable, perhaps unique, overlap between the professional, scientific study of caves and the amateur studies carried out by those who mainly visit caves for sport.

Weather Watch

Countless observant people without any instruments other than their own senses originally laid the foundations of meteorology, which has progressed since the 17th century into the highly technical science of today. Satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us with the minimum of delay, computers solve in minutes abstruse mathematical sums at a speed beyond the capability of the human brain. Meteorological theory is peppered with long words which have little meaning to the non-professional. It sometimes seems there is no room left for simple weather wisdom, but nothing could be further from the truth. Human experience is still the vital ingredient which translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere.",C2
"Mission to Mars 

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. 
This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel, for fuel efficiency is a priority – the 2018 deadline has been fixed since the next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn’t until 2031. It’s a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies. Given that these can be put in place soon enough, the spacecraft might just make it. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to achieve these ambitious goals will not be in vain, as they will lead to valuable advances for future missions.

"Garbage in, garbage out

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be.

Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals, rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip.
To economists, this ceremony is peculiar, because in most places it is free. Yes, households pay for the service out of local taxes but the family that fills four bins with rubbish each week pays no more than the elderly couple that fills one.
Yet the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero at all. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more the local authorities have to pay in landfill and tipping fees. This looks like the most basic of economic problems: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish.
The obvious solution is to make households pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. That will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more (assuming that local governments provide collection points for suitable materials).
But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, have found, what appears to be the logical approach to an everyday problem has surprisingly intricate and sometimes disappointing results.
Research focused on several American towns and cities which, in the past few years, have started charging households for generating rubbish. The commonest system is to sell stickers or tags which householders attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up in the weekly collection. 
In a paper published last year Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman concentrated on the effects of one such scheme, introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may sound like sensible use of market forces. In fact, the authors conclude, the schemes benefits did not cover the cost of printing materials, the commissions to sellers and the wages of the people running the scheme.
True, the number of bags or cans did fall sharply, by 37%. But this was largely thanks to the ‘Seattle stomp', a frantic dance first noticed when that distant city introduced rubbish pricing. Rather than buy more tags, people simply crammed more garbage - about 40% more — into each container by jumping on it if necessary.
As we all know, such compacting is done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals, however enthusiastically. The weight of rubbish collected (a better indicator of disposal costs than volume) fell by a modest 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities where no pricing scheme was in place, and which were used as a rough-and-ready control group, it fell by 3.5% in any case.
Less pleasing still, some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay to have their rubbish removed. This is hard to measure directly but the authors guess that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish.
The one bright spot in the whole experience seems to have been a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) rather than pay to have their refuse carted away. But the fee may have little to do with the growth in recycling, as many citizens were already participating in Charlottesville's voluntary scheme.
In a more recent study, Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman explore the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion from this broader study is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish - but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts quantity only by 0.3%.
This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns, but is it so surprising? To reduce their output of rubbish by a lot, people would have to buy less of just about everything. A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference.
If that’s the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw out more rubbish than in poorer ones and they have less time for recycling.
Should we conclude that the idea of charging households for the rubbish they produce is daft? Not at all: free disposal after all is surely too cheap. But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.",C2
"MUSIC AND THEATRE

Up until quite recently, I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house, I learned that opera is, in fact, only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be, of course. But I come from a different world, the world of the theatre, where the word and the actor speaking it have primacy, where there is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way, and where performer and audience (mostly) speak the same language.
At any musical performance, whether in concert hall or opera house, there will generally be a substantial minority of people who, like me, have little technical or academic understanding of music. Some of them will be aware of, possibly even embarrassed by, how much they don’t know. Most will be awestruck by the skill of the performers. A dazzling coloratura or an impeccable string section are easy to admire. Even a moderately good musician is showing us the results of years of punishingly hard work. Being in the audience for top-class music is not unlike watching an athletics match - we know athletes are doing something broadly similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also recognise by how much it excess our best efforts.
Theatre audiences by contrast, come with a different set of expectations. In the main they do not understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually impressed when an actor completes a long and difficult speech (although ‘how do you learn all those lines?’ is the question every actor gets asked). None of this means that theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall, indeed quite a lot of them are the same people. What perhaps it does mean is that audiences and performer meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event. The question is, does music need to learn anything from the theatre about this relationship? I would say yes, partly because I have seen how a different approach can transform the concert-goers experience.
Music in live performance is inherently theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, vulnerable to the possibility that something will go unexpectedly wrong, reaching into the imagination of the listener not just as an individual but as part of a collective. The conventions which still largely dominate music presentation, including strict dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasise the difference between players and listeners in a way which often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. On the other hand, the tendency of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a canicular piece of virtuosity, while it is often a spontaneous expression of appreciation, can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the whole work.
Is there anything to be done? Of course a huge amount is being done. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ‘serious’ music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the staging of Jonathan Dove’s community opera In Search of Angels, which followed the action from location to location within a cathedral and then out into the town. It was a musical experience of the highest order, in which the skills, and the generosity, of the professional musicians were absolutely central and it was also life-changing for many of the audience, who were not just there to see and hear but also to contribute directly.
Perhaps what I yearn for in music is a bit more of the risk and radicalism that theatre at its best can display. Sometimes it can come from the use of unfamiliar or challenging locations, where normal expectations are disrupted. This can have startling effects on performer and audience alike. Comforts may have to be foregone, perhaps the acoustic isn’t great, maybe it’s a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be intrepid as they follow artists into the most unpromising spaces. I accept that most plays get put on in a pretty uncontroversial way, not greatly different from what happens in a conmen hall. However I remain convinced that something can and should happen to change the conventions of music-going. The only authority I can claim is that of the enthusiast: I love, and live by, the theatre and I spend as much time (and money) as I can going to hear music. I want them both to thrive, and for more and more people to get the pleasure I get from being the audience. ",C2

Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the fairyland city, in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong.
Either in the travel agency or at the check-in desk, or in some anonymous computer, a small calamity was conceived. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick they had handed their tickets to a girl in the yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She’d addressed them by name, had checked the details on their tickets and said that that was lovely. An hour later it had surprised them to hear elderly people on the plane talking in North of England accents. Keith said there must have been a cancellation, or possibly the Italian class was on a second plane.
They ordered two drinks, and then two more. ‘The coach’ll take us on,’ a stout woman with spectacles announced when they touched down. ‘Keep all together now.’ There’s been no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach drew in at its destination, Keith explained that that was clearly what this was. As they stepped out of the coach it was close on midnight: fatigued and travel-stained, they did not feel like questioning their right to the beds they were offered.
But the next morning, when it became apparent that they were being offered them for the duration of their holiday, they became alarmed.
‘We have the lake, and the water birds,’ the receptionist smilingly explained. ‘And we may take the steamer to Interlaken.'
‘An error has been made,’ Keith informed the man, keeping the register of his voice even, for it was essential to be calm. He was aware of his wive’s agitated breathing close beside him.
‘We were meant to be in Venice. In the Pensione Concordia.’
‘I do not know the name, sir. This is Switzerland.’
‘A coach is to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night, that woman.’
‘Your group is booked twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. To make an alteration now, sir, if you have changed your minds -‘
‘We haven’t changed our minds. Theres been a mistake.’
The receptionist shook his head. He did not know about a mistake.
‘The man who made the booking,’ Dawne interrupted, ‘was bald, with glasses and a moustache.’ She gave the name of the travel agency in London.
‘Some problem, have we?’ a woman said, beaming at Keith. She was the stout woman he had referred to as an official. They’d seen her talking to the yellow-and-red girl at Gatwick. On the plane she’d walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people.
‘My name is Franks,’ she was saying now. ‘I’m married to the man with the bad leg.’
‘Are you in charge, Mrs Franks?’ Dawne enquired. ‘Only we’re in the wrong hotel.’
Again she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald-headed counter clerk, mentioning his spectacles and his moustache. Keith interrupted her. ’It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it all to her.’
‘We should have known when they weren’t from Dover,’ Dawne contributed. ‘We heard them talking about Darlington.’
Keith made an impatient sound. He wished sh’ed leave the talking to him.
‘We noticed you at Gatwick,’ Keith said. ‘We knew you were in charge of things.’
‘And I noticed you. I counted you, although I daresay you didn’t see me doing that. Now, let me explain to you. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends its clients to, many different holidays at different prices. There are, for instance, villa holidays for the adventurous under-thirty-fives. There are treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas.’
‘Now, what I am endeavouring to say to you good people is that all tickets and labels are naturally similar, the yellow with the two red bands.’ Mrs Franks suddenly laughed. ‘So if you simply followed other people with the yellow-and-red label you might imagine you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course,’ she added soothingly, ‘that couldn’t happen in a million years.’
‘We’re not meant to be in Switzerland,’ Keith doggedly persisted.
‘Well, let’s just see, shall we?’
Unexpectediy, Mrs Franks turned and went away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer behind the reception desk. The sound of typing could be heard.
‘She seems quite kind,’ Dawne whispered, ‘that woman.’ Keith wasn’t listening. He tried to go over in his mind every single thing that had occurred: handing the girl the tickets, sitting down to wait, and then the girl leading the way to the plane, and then the pilot’s voice welcoming them aboard, and the air hostess with the smooth black hair going round to see that everyone’s seat belt was fastened.
‘Nice to have some young people along,’ an elderly man’s voice interrupted Keith’s thoughts. ‘Nottage the name is.’ The old man’s wife was with him, both of them looking as if they were in their eighties. They’d slept like logs, she said, best night’s sleep they’d had for years, which of course would be due to the lakeside air.
‘Thats nice,’ Dawne said.
Keith walked out of the reception area and Dawne followed him. On the forecourt of the hotel they didn’t say to one another that there was an irony in the catastrophe that had occurred. On their first holiday since their honeymoon they’d landed themselves in a package tour of elderly people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. In his bossy way Uncle had said so himself when they’d tried to persuade him to accompany them.",C2
"Blogging: Confessing to the world 

Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, ‘Hey, I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous – and we are lost. 
Depressing? Perhaps, but don’t give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity’s temptations and perils – all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it’s worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the ‘WWW’, as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once. 
Hall’s ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall’s site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he’d fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told ‘either the blog goes, or I do’. He’d published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, ‘it makes people not trust me’. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to ‘make people want to be with you’, you’ll be disappointed. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong’s blog to every vice president at her company – including some whom she’d mocked – and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the ‘online distribution effect’: that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we’d never dream of saying in person. But our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes. 
Armstrong’s saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of ‘mommy bloggers’ and her writing supports her house hold. Once a poster child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should. ",C2
"Othello

The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. Indeed the whole cast is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio’s competitive games with the other young officers get dangerously out of hand, and the moment when Iago begins to lose control and has to struggle to get a grip on himself. And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production.

Lake Vostok

In the heart of Antarctica, nothing stirs. On the fringes of the continent there are penguins, seals and birds aplenty. But up on the great white plateau in the interior, life has no foothold. Except, that is, in a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometres of ice, directly below the coldest spot on earth. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists can hardly wait to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within. Geologists and glaciologists are hot on their heels. For two years now, researchers round the world have been plotting ways to uncover the lakes secrets, and, if they get their wish, in the next few years we will witness the decade of Lake Vostok.

Scientists

There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists; the expression ‘because it’s there’ springs to mind. Sure we all know its the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from the atom to the black hole. But what these guys want to know is why we want to know all of this in the first place and why can’t science explain why we want to know?
Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than get bogged down in debates over the point of it all. I would have thought that the crucial issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognise that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when and why to use it.",C2
"Family Business

‘Look here, it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice in tow, had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent’s Day, in the course of which I was presented with the Latin prize and the prize for the girl who had done best in her end-of-school exams. He had had a long conversation with my headteacher, and now here we were bound for home and holidays.
‘What isn’t?’ I said, though I had guessed the trend of his thoughts from my father’s unusual silence. He was a talkative man as a rule. ‘You can’t fool me. You’ll do what you want now,’ he said. ‘What with all those certificates. I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.’
'So?' I said, brazening it out. ‘Mightn’t that be useful?’
‘I am also given to understand,’ he went on, and then I knew the confrontation was coming, ‘that you have ambitions to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!’ My father knew quite a lot about barristers and the law.
‘I just said that,’ I said. ‘I couldn’t think of anything else to say!’
‘And apparently,' he went on, ‘you have the right sort of personality - you can pick the bones out of a mass of material pretty quickly, you have the gift of the gab and you enjoy performing.’
'I don’t know about that,’ I said. ‘All I know is what I see in television dramas.’
‘Be that as it may,' he went on, pulling himself together, ‘I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you’ll go to Oxford University, and after that I can't see you fancying it.’
The trouble was that, like most children of hereditary trades, I did feel confined by the family expectations. I could see there were various professions open to me, and I wanted to explore the possibilities. At the same time, like a coward, I didn’t want to upset my father. I wasn’t as frightened of him as Maurice was - I was the favourite - but I found him formidable.
‘It’s too soon to know,’ I said feebly.
‘I tell you you’re not going to want to join us,’ said my father, who had an annoying way of usually being right in such prophecies, ‘and it’s a pity because you’ve got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.’
‘There’s still Maurice,’ I said, sullen. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business. ‘Anyway,’ I went on, ‘you could always use me as a sort of consultant.’
It was not as if my mother was around to lend a hand - she had died early in my childhood and my father had brought me and Maurice up. Maurice was two years younger than I was, and because he was motherless, early in our lives I got into the habit of taking care of him. It was not a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was so successful we lived in a good deal of luxury - in a big house in London, posh schools for both of us, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house buzzed with good talk and interesting encounters.
‘I tell you what,’ my father continued our conversation. ‘You can go on helping us out in holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us you can. It will give you a bit of pocket money, and be a real help to me.’
‘OK,’ I said, relieved to be spared immediate choices and decisions, and especially the bout of depression and sulks my father would sink into if I opposed him. This was the way he controlled us. So it happened. In my last term at school, and then on vacations from university, I lent a hand, never more than about twice a year, and always on the safer assignments. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I intended to wear when I took my final exams.
It was in my last term that my father came up to see me and drove me out to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks to go. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I kept my head and spent these last precious days carefully arranging information in my mind, he might well be right. I felt poised, confident, concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me to do one last assignment for him, that it was the most important piece of business the family firm had ever attempted, and that he would see that it was more than worth my while. 
‘But Dad,’ I protested, ‘I’ve got my final exams coming up, and I just need to concentrate on that. It’s really important that I do well and I don’t want to have to think about anything else just now.’
I could tell that such pressures were simply beyond my father’s imagination (or was it that he was somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would interpret a refusal from me as a heartless betrayal in his hour of need.
That was not all. As he described the procedures I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father — the clarity and resourcefulness with which he set about his life’s work, the dynamic energy, the perfect self-control of the man. In his way he was a sort of genius, and I bowed to that in him. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.
‘All right,’ I said. ‘I’ll do it.’",C2
"Einstein

Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations, from computers to encyclopaedias.
Most people know little of what Einstein did, except that he developed some mysterious theories under the heading ‘relativity’, which are famous for being incomprehensible, and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience.
Einstein was part of a gigantic leap forward in scientific thinking, an intellectual revolution that heralded the birth of twentieth century science. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature.
Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy. Previous descriptions had depended on Isaac Newton’s view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

Young Readers

Throughout our childhoods, Lydia and I distrusted any prize-winning book because we knew it would be worthy; and for ‘worthy’, read ‘boring’, we thought.
While our mother had been inclined to abhor our philistinism in tones of despising innuendo, our father would cheerfully dish us out tenpences, chapter by chapter, as inducements to make us cast our eyes over the occasional improving volume. Or he would slip the odd superior book in amongst our Christmas and birthday presents, labelled in bold marker pen, ‘This Book is NOT Literature’. Though we dismissed most of his offerings as ‘boys’ books', he did, in this way, expose us to some shorter works of decent fiction and, just once, to a well-known anthology of verse.

Language

‘The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous’, wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. The marvellous secret has long proved a launch pad for strange ideas. ‘Primitive man was likely to make sounds like “meuh” when sensing danger,’ claimed Charles Caller in 1928. “Meuh"" has a plaintive sound. The human who wandered over a hostile land inhabited by awesome beasts uttered desperate noises, and languages have preserved some echo of his lamentation such as malaria meaning “fever” or the Latin mors meaning “death”.
Faced with such weird speculations, many avoided the topic, regarding it as a playground for cranks, but recently, language origin and evolution have become key research areas. Language probably developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. In the main speech was used for friendly interaction, and was an important tool in power struggles. Information-swapping was probably not an important original role - contrary to the views of philosopher John Locke, who spoke of language as a ‘great conduit’ for conveying knowledge.",C2
"The Lure of the Kitchen

When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is, on the face of it, an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long, pressured, menial - and badly paid.
But such considerations didn’t put me off. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard;
the social scene was insular and self-important. Being a chef seemed the perfect antidote to intellectual and social posturing. It promised a seriousness and integrity lacking in my college life.
But my desire to cook was not simply a reaction to being a student. It also expressed an aesthetic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards.
After this, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretence, distracting me from my true course. I acquired my real education haphazardly and deficiently by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens and preparing extravagant meals.

Extract from a novel

The school's swimming instructor was an ex-drill sergeant, small and muscle-bound, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pools edge, put my hands above my head and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet. I practised that manoeuvre until the hour was up. The next visit, he got me standing upright, and diving off the edge. The instructor was a martinet and every time I surfaced he looked at me with distaste: ‘Don’t look down, look up!’ 'Keep your legs straight.’ 'Point your toes I said!’ The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed outrageously high as I stood there, trying to work up my courage. Gradually the echoing voices disappeared and I felt as if I were cocooned in silence. I waved my arms vaguely in the way I’d been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled ignominiously, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not diminish my euphoria. That’s what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.

The Traveller

To those of us for whom a comfortable bed, running water and the probability of living at least until tomorrow are of prime importance, the phenomenon of the traveller appears as incomprehensible as it is intriguing. Here are people who have succumbed to the treacherous seduction of the unknown, who actually choose to put their lives at risk by climbing the sheer and icy face of an avalanche-ridden mountain; who sail alone in frail craft through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing more palatable is on offer and who can live, day and night for months on end, in the shadow and the promise of the unknown.
It is easy to dismiss such people as oddities - as indeed they are - to be relegated to the ranks of the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers or indeed writers. That they exist cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they occupy lies well outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as an irrelevancy. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answerphones, glad that the only risks to our own health are predictable ones such as making a suicidal dash across a city street.

SAILING

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his element, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is obviously a competent one. His overriding reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is guaranteed to provide alarms and achievements for his pen to celebrate.
Raban's little boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives mariners their position to within a few metres, anywhere on the earth’s surface. Strongly as he approves of this instrument, there is more than a touch of primitivism in Raban’s attitude to other sea-faring aids. He thinks the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a ‘fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea’. Raban maintains that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main object of the steersman’s gaze, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things going on in it, is now reduced to a mere space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long stretches by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves.",C2
"Writing by hand and on screen

Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. I am sure the reason was that they were physically hard to write. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. What would be difficult to alter or erase was written with care. The casual facility of the computer leads to sloppiness. Most writers using word processors find the time spent correcting early drafts more or less equates with the time originally spent on handwritten text.
Equally, the e-mail, unlike the handwritten letter, is emotionally ponderous. This electronic Eros is said to have revive the art of the love letter. Millions of these missives now flow down the lines, where previously there was only idle chatter. Hurrah for that. At least these e-mails are written, in a sort of English and a sort of grammar: But words printed on a screen pack a monotonous punch. Their writers are often unaccustomed to the power of the written word and tend, in computer jargon, to ‘flare’. Their meaning becomes exaggerated and distorted in transmission. And printed words written in haste lack the care and character of handwriting.

The CD

I put down my cup and went to inspect the CD. The case was disappointing but the rainbow-silver disc inside looked interesting.
‘Wonderful little things, aren’t they?’ Mr Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed, gingerly handing the disc to him. ‘Amazing they manage to squeeze seventy minutes of music onto them,’ he continued, bending to the hi-fi device. He switched it on and all sorts of lights came on. He pressed a button and a little drawer slid out of the machine. He put the disc inside, pressed the button again and the tray glided back in again. ‘Of course, some people say they sound sterile, but I think they…’
‘Do you have to turn them over, like records?’ I asked.
‘What? No,’ Mr Warriston said, straightening. ‘No, you only play one side.’
‘Why?’ I asked him.
He looked nonplussed, and then thoughtful. ‘You know,’ he said, ‘I’ve no idea. I don’t see why you couldn’t make both sides playable and double the capacity…’ He stared down at the machine. ‘You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand… hmm.’ He smiled at me. ‘Yes, good point.’ He nodded over at my wooden chair. ‘Anyway. Come on, let’s get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?’
I smiled, pleased to have thought of a technical question Mr Warriston could not answer.

Books versus Electronic Text

In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury was spot on when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we'd have marvelled at the improvement. Most of the propaganda, dazzled by newness, states that electronic text is a change comparable to the invention of printing and that it is already nearly completed. It ignores the fact that shifts in consciousness take generations and such rhetoric falls into the trap of chronocentricity, the egotism that one's own generation sits on the very cusp of history. Take this treasure from Mighty Micro, a book from 1979: ‘The 1980s will see the book as we know it, and as our ancestors created and cherished it, begin a slow and steady slide to oblivion.' So far, so wrong. Reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most never do it and, in any case, the organisation of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text. Techno-proselytisers have extracted virtue here by claiming that inherent flightiness leads to new forms of narrative and imaginative space. But there's nothing new about 'non-linearity'. Lots of books have never been read from beginning to end - most religious texts, dictionaries and poetry collections spring to mind. What is new is not so much the branchings of electronic text as that computers don't invite the joined-up thinking of reading anything in its entirety.

The Office

Charles Walked through the office door and into a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of the paper avalanche which had buried it on the very day it was put down, and the naked desk was dark wood, just as he remembered it from the Sotheby’s auction of five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being put in their proper drawers. Twelve years of trade journals now filled the shelves on one wall.
Kathleen strained to close the door of the filing cabinet and then turned on him. ‘You have to go to computers, Charles. This is just too much.’
‘Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing.’ He was admiring the room, its antique furniture. He was not visualising a computer or any other mechanical device in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ‘Simply amazing,’ he said, altogether skirting the issue of computers.
Over the two years he had known her, they’d had this conversation many times. She could never understand his resistance to the technology when he was so adept at computers and had even published an important paper on computer-mode giftedness. She had been the inspiration for that paper. Via the keyboard, she could dip her fingers into the stuffing of any software and make it into a new animal that could sit up and bark at the moon if she wished.",C2
"Food

There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know
I may be preaching to the converted, because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one, but so often we imagine that, unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish, it is hardly worth attempting. Not so. Just by throwing a few roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery and a few herbs into water you will get the most delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a tin. Instead of buying an over-sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, emulsifiers and additives, in five minutes you can turn out the most delicious confection that both grown-ups and children will love.
Cooking is also an offering, and it is a gesture of care and love to bring once own creation, however humble or simple, to the table. Sharing food is so rich in symbolism, of our deepest human needs, that it is hardly surprising all our festivities and celebrations take place around tables, be they birthdays, anniversaries, engagements or whatever! No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! Nor would many people wish to have a business deal discussed over tinned soup.

In the Elevator

This morning, Alistair had made a stab at straightening up his office, but correspondence still littered every surface. Quarterly tax forms, state and federal, bulged out of desk drawers and cardboard boxes, all waiting on a day when he was in the filing mode. And then there was all the added paperwork that went along with owning an apartment building. The hundred-odd books and a few years’ worth of journals were only in proximity to the new bookshelves.
As the elevator bore him closer to his floor, he knew that Mallory would be on time for their appointment. She would be knocking on the door of his empty office on the hour, not a second before or after. She was as compulsive about time as she was about neatness.
How would she react to the mess? She might assume he’d been vandalised. He could walk in behind her and feign shock.
Mrs Wilson, his cleaning woman, had arrived while he was scrambling around on the floor, trying desperately to clear a few square feet of the carpet. Putting his head out of the office door as she was turning her key in the lock of his apartment, he had smiled at her, his eyes filled with hope. Her own eyes had turned hard. Fat chance I’m going in there, said the back of her head as she had disappeared into his residence, which was her territory and all that she might be held accountable for.
He knew Mrs Wilson believed him to be a visitor from somewhere else, perhaps some point straight up, miles out, but nowhere on the surface of her own earth, which was square and shaped by the streets of Brooklyn.

KAREN

It was a simple desire - not to be like her mother - that led Karen to create her own story, her own mythology, a mythology of difference and strength. Tn the tale that she constructed for herself, there were significant moments in her progress; such as the day she was twelve years old and her brother quick-swung a golf club behind him and hit her full in the eye. At the first moment of impact, she was convinced of immediate blindness. But the bone hod protected her, as the doctor from the high-walled house later assured her. The golf club had clean missed the eye and she was left with only a few stitches that healed to a pole drawing of past suffering. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s white-walled consulting room, overlooking the tennis courts, ond saw her mother clear before her, muttering predictably and paradoxically about both miracles and small mercies, she knew that she was saved for some purpose.

Miss Fogerty

Miss Fogerty, returning briskly to her duties across the wet grass of the village green, was both excited and saddened by the scene she had just witnessed. It is always exhilarating to be the first to know something of note, particularly in a small community, and Miss Fogerty’s quiet life held little excitement. On the other hand, her grief for Dr Bailey’s condition was overwhelming. He has attended her for many years and she remembered with gratitude his concern for her annual bouts of laryngitis which were, fortunately, about the only troubles for which she had to consult him.
His most valuable quality, Miss Fogerty considered, was his making one feel that there was always plenty of time, and that he truly wished to hear about his patients’ fears and perplexities. It was this quality, above all others, which had so endeared the good doctor to the village and its environs. He had always been prepared to give — of his time, of his knowledge, and of his humour. His reward had been outstanding loyalty and affection.",C2
"Screen Learning

A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur,’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme, so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not a lot.
There is a modish rush to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning via a screen a good method? One writer tells how he tried out an interactive programme with his son. The father diligently read the words while the son fiddled with the pictures. ‘Had he spent ten minutes in front of a book, he might possibly have learned something,’ said his father.
Television, as my son and his noodles demonstrate, is an impressionistic, suggestive medium. Research about television and learning shows that learning goes on in a learning environment where dialogue is taking place with teachers or parents. It needs to be mediated. There is nothing wrong with harnessing new technology to teach our children, but there is still a big role for formal education.

Hollywood

By 1918, four-fifths of the film-making capacity of the world had relocated to Hollywood. Locals disapproved, seeing their suburb of Los Angeles infected by these new vulgarians. But in the end snobbery yielded to the true American value, success. And success is the box-office gross. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: one that may make a star, but must make somebody’s fortune.
In less than a century, Hollywood has grown from a toffee-nosed village to a town as famous as New York, Rome or Paris. And physically, of course, it has changed beyond recognition: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet in a way, it is still a village - parochial, with limited horizons - just a little bit of Los Angeles. For all who live and work in it, there is one topic of conversation - films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who’s been stabbed in the back, who is 'attached' to which project. Those who have been successful often try to get away: to work there, but live somewhere else. Yet it is still the one place in the world to which almost everyone who is anyone in show-business (and plenty who agent) eventually gravitates.

Photography

Photography was invented by nineteenth century artists as an art form for their own purposes. These men were seeking a lasting, literal record of their visual surroundings and they found it. The new combination of illumination, lens, shutter, and flat surface coated with chemicals sensitive to light produced images more lasting, more convincing in their reality, and more richly detailed than painters could produce manually in weeks and months of effort. This alone was enough to throw consternation into the ranks of fellow artists; and, after their first reaction of pleasure in a new kind of image, art critics rallied with the haughty charge that photography was not, and could not be, an art. The actual world in which we live had too strong a grip on photography, they said, and pictures so dependent upon mechanical means could not be called acts of man’s creative imagination.
Despite the critics, photographers knew that they had found a new art form, a new mode of expression. They used the new tools as other artists before and after them have used brush and pencil - to interpret the world, to present a vision of nature and its structure as well as the things and the people in it.

Book Illustration

During the black-and-white era of book illustration it was axiomatic that each and every children’s book called for some form of illustration. This extended to the large category of novels for the upper reading ages, which was to suffer progressive attrition as print runs shortened. The level of activity in all areas of children’s publishing remained considerable, but it was run predominantly as a low-budget operation for most of the period and as such encouraged a fair amount of routine and mediocre work, although the finest artists seldom submitted less than their professional best. Therefore, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house, a wonderful place for research or for browsing, and one in which to make immediate finds or to begin to re-evaluate a fertile artistic period. The real treasures are bound to return to public display, whether enduringly through reissues of individual titles and new publications about the artists who illustrated them - or from time to time in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after a period of neglect, this is starting to happen and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be seen to be at work. In due course, an enterprising publisher will doubtlessly see the potential for a series of classic children’s book illustrations from this period either in facsimile reprint, or in freshly-designed editions using the original artwork where it survives.

"Surviving in a Foreign Land

I have been welcomed warmly. It’s a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very, very isolated place. At any one time, there are some forty odd souls - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers — in a close-knit community where everyone mucks in. My school French is proving adequate - just — to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast.
There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose terrified at the silence which fell when I spoke, anxious in a way I cannot remember since the first weeks of school. I still grin inanely, or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is nothing to do with loss of company or communication, it’s because
I’ve lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Elliot

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other and he took no notice of me. He never forgot a face though, and when I ran across him here or there he shook hands with me cordially, but showed no desire to further our acquaintance; and if I saw him at the opera, say, he being with a person of high rank, he was inclined not to catch sight of me. But then I happened to make a somewhat startling success as a playwright, and presently I became aware that Elliot regarded me with a warmer feeling. One day, I received a note from him asking me to lunch and I conceived the notion that he was trying me out. But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.

Alfred Hitchcock

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t a message that stirred the audience, nor was it a great performance, he believed that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience.
Hitchcock’s self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable, he was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn’t deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience. ",C2
"Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake within a year of his and Lois's moving in. A possession which can only be afforded by the exercise of stringent and calculated economy is best not afforded at all. But at the time it had seemed a sensible, as well as a desirable, move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand. It was Lois who had argued the more strongly for a move, but he had put up little resistance to arguments which at the time had seemed compelling: the flat wasn’t really suitable for a family, they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these, of course, could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. Mornington Mansions had never been an acceptable address for an up-and-coming young barrister and a successful businesswoman. She never said it without a sense that even speaking the words subtly diminished her standing, socially and economically.
Lois had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise. The overcrowded tube journey, stayed in a mood of envious resentment, had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He would recall his grandfather’s house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner from the kitchen, his grandmother’s insistence that the returning breadwinner, tired from his exhausting day in court, should be given peace, a little gentle cosseting, and relief from every petty domestic anxiety. She had been a 'lawyer's wife', indefatigable in legal good causes, elegantly present at all lawyers' functions, apparently content with the sphere of life which she had made her own. Well, that world had passed for ever. Lois had made it plain before their marriage that her career was as important as his. It hardly needed saying, this was, after all, a modern marriage. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.
Venetia must have come straight from the court to their offices and she had been in a dangerous mood. Something or someone had upset her. But the word 'upset' was too weak, too bland for the intensity of furious disgust with which she had confronted him. Someone had driven her to the limit of her endurance. He cursed himself. If he hadn't been in his room, if he'd only left a minute earlier, the encounter wouldn't have taken place, she would have had the night to think it over, to consider what, if anything, she ought to do. Probably nothing. The morning might have brought sense. He remembered every word of her angry accusations.
'I defended Brian Cartwright today. Successfully. He told me that when you were his counsel four years ago you knew before trial that he had bribed three of the jury. You did nothing. You went on with the case. Is that true?'
'He’s lying. It isn't true.’
'He also said that he passed over some shares in his company to your fiancée. Also before trial. Is that true?’
'I tell you, he's lying. None of its true.’
The denial had been as instinctive as an arm raised to ward off a blow and had sounded unconvincing even to his own ears. His whole action had been one of guilt. The first cold horror draining his face was succeeded by a hot flush, bringing back shameful memories of his headmaster's study, of the terror of the inevitable punishment. He had made himself look into her eyes and had seen the look of contemptuous disbelief. If only he'd had some warning. He knew now what he should have said: 'Cartwright told me after the trial but I didn't believe him. I don't believe him now. That man will say anything to make himself important.’
But he had told a more direct, more dangerous lie, and she had known that it was a lie. Even so, why the anger, why the disgust? What was that old misdemeanour to do with her? Who had sent Venetia Aldridge to be guardian of the conscience of their legal practice? Or of his, come to that? Was her own conscience so clear, her behaviour in court always immaculate? Was she justified in destroying his career? And it would be destruction. He wasn't sure what exactly she could do, how far she was prepared to go, but if this got about, even as a rumour, he was done for.",C2
"I chose this place to live, believing I would find anonymity among those who did not care if the plaster and glass and paintwork of rented houses splintered and decayed, who were not reproached by gardens gone to seed and rotting sofas. In that hope, as in most things, I was proved wrong. People in the shops, who are living their real lives, even if you aren't, soon start to recognise you. Next door’s lull-blown roses pouring over the fence are persistent reminders that the gardens were loved once.
Usually, I stay inside trying to forget that there is a summer going on out there, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying in the transparent space between the treetops and roofs. I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair and my arms and hands are tingling with stings and scratches. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.
‘Been doing a spot of clearing, I see.’
It’s my upstairs neighbour, Jaz, leaning out of the window, the author of several unpublished manuscripts I am sometimes called upon to dissemble about in my capacity as an English teacher. I have a copy of the latest in my possession now.
‘How's the work going, Jaz?'
‘For goodness sake. In no other profession is one called on to account for oneself a thousand times a day by every Tom, Dick or Harry.’ Her voice tails off, then rallies. ‘Tell you what, Ann, I’ve got something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.’
I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I see now, dully, that it looks mangled and bereft. The only access to this garden is through my flat and Jaz is banging on my door. ‘So, you’re on holiday now, you jammy so-and-so.’ She sprawls, in shorts and vest, on the chair while I drop a cushion onto what had once been a little lawn. ‘Cheers,’ she says in her delusion of youth, ‘I should’ve gone into teaching - a writer doesn't have holidays. Still, you know what they say, those who can, do, those who can’t, teach.'
And there are those who can neither write nor teach.
‘So, what plans for the hols?’
All my postponed dread of the school year’s ending engulfs me. Empty days. Hot pavements blobbed with melting chewing gum. The walk down to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench.
‘Actually, I’m going down to Stonebridge tomorrow. I’ve been meaning to ask you if you'd feed the cats.’ My heart starts racing as I speak.
‘Of course I will,’ Jaz says. ‘If I’m around,’ knowing, as I did, that she would be. ‘So where will you stay? Some bijou B and B?’
‘No. I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.’ It isn’t true that I shall stay there, but then I spend my life dealing with fiction of one sort or another.
‘Going back to your roots. So what do you think of it so far? My opus?’
My silence on the subject has forced Jaz to enquire about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which lies half-heartedly half-read on my desk.
I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing presents and mall-order goodies to other houses and delivering returned manuscripts in silly bags to hers. Something prompts me to speak honestly for once.
‘Let me give you a little tip, dear,’ I begin.
‘What?’ She is affronted.
‘Try writing about nice people for a change, pretty people who at least aspire to being good: a touch less solipsism, a bit more fiction…’
‘Teachers!' Jaz is a mutinous schoolgirl about to snatch back a poorly marked essay.
‘I myself keep a journal, I have for years, in which I write down something good, however small or trivial, about each day.’ My words sound as prissy as my old-fashioned print dress.
‘Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.’
Oh, I’ve got a life. I’ve got my work, and I go out sometimes and fly home again, sitting on the tube with my nose in a book.
When at last we go inside, my calm kitchen gives a moment’s reassurance, then out of the blue comes the image of my school geography teacher Miss Tarrantine, who must have been about the age I am now, closing an ancient reptilian eyelid in a monstrous wink as she tells us, ‘I’ve had my moments.' We nearly died.",C2
"Writing Reviews

Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view.

Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. There are deadlines, there are restrictions, normally quite severe, on their length; and when published they claim houseroom only for as long as the newspaper they are printed in - a day or a week, at most a month. Moreover, the literary status of reviews tends to be settled by their ephemerality. It is usually supposed, not only by the public but, quite often, by the writers themselves, that reviewing is work that nobody would do if there weren't some reason — shortage of cash would he cited most often, though another good reason is that you can't work all day on a novel or a ‘serious’
book of any sort - which prevents them from occupying their time with something more valuable.
Yet reviewing is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to be bright, brisk and summarily fair in the six or eight hundred words of an ordinary newspaper review, quite another to control, without looseness of argument, the six or eight thousand words sometimes allowed by international journals. And the fifteen hundred words of a leading piece in the weekly magazines present some of the problems of both short and long. Not that length is the only consideration. For one thing, the reviewer obviously needs to think about the probable audience, the weekend skimmer at one end of the scale, the person already interested enough in the subject to tackle a serious review-article at the other. Finally, a reviewer needs to know quite a bit about quite a number of things; and must be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. It follows almost infallibly that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.
The American novelist Johh Updike, who rather looks down on criticism — ‘hugging the shore’ he calls it - nevertheless enjoys some coastal reviewing in the intervals between his transoceanic novel-writing. Understandably reluctant to allow even his less ambitious voyages to go without any permanent record, he gathers together his every review, however short, into volumes with mildly self-deprecating titles. It might be thought that lesser persons should accept ephemerality as the penalty appropriate to their coastal caution, but it is hand to see why, if they can get away with it, they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the measure of permanence, and the measure of vanity, proper to their station, especially if they believe that some of their best writing has been ‘buried’ in reviews. I admit to feeling this about my own work.
My own principal occupation has been academic, and most of my ‘serious’ books are recognisably academic products, the sort of thing professors like, and are expected to do as part of their jobs. However, the English-speaking world (I think fortunately) acknowledges nothing comparable to the sharp distinction people from other cultures make between reviewing and literary study — and so with us it is quite usual for the same people to do both. The days are gone when other academics reviled reviewer-professors for unseemly self-display, or waste of academic time, or betrayal of the dignity of their institutions. And complaints from non-professors, to the effect that the professors are taking the bread out of their mouths, are also less common than they were, partly because there is so much more reviewing nowadays that practically everyone can have some, partly, no doubt, because the bread is often such a meagre ration.
My own view is that these arrangements are good for both readers — since they can be fairly certain the reviewer has at least some idea what he is talking about — and professors, if only because the work helps to keep them sane. It also reminds them that they have a duty, easily neglected, to make themselves intelligible to non-professors. When talking among themselves they may feel some need to be impressively arcane, but when addressing intelligent non-professors they need to make sure they are communicating effectively.
Finally, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, and despite all that can be said to dignify it, reviewing must be a secondary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough. ",C2
"Build it yourself at the UK’s first bamboo bike workshop 

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 

It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and apart from a mechanic deep in the bowels of a truck, the only sign of life among the small factories on a backstreet is a whine of machinery from an upper window – work has begun at Bamboo Bike Club, Britain’s only bamboo bike-building course. I’ve gone along to watch the action. 
There’s a sense of energy and industry. And of fun. Woodwork class was never like this. Bamboo is one of the most interesting trends to emerge in bike construction. Names like Californian manufacturer Calfee Design or Yorkshire’s Bamboo Bikes have revived a construction method pioneered as early as 1894. The problem for most cyclists is the price. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies retails for $2,995, or £1,868. 
It was this, plus the design challenge, that led James and Ian to spend years cooped up in a shed in Brecon, Wales. Their idea was to establish a boutique bamboo bike business with products within reach of the average cyclist. 
Only after they had refined their research into a marketable product – James now tosses out phrases like ‘close-noded thick-wall tubes’ while talking about bamboo – did they realise they were on the wrong track. ‘We realised we didn’t want just to sell frames. We wanted to share the joy of making something; the craft of creating something unique and sustainable,’ James explains. 
The outcome was something more community than company, and as such, the Bamboo Bike Club is still an occupation sandwiched between full-time jobs – James makes wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they seem to be on the right track, with monthly courses whose competitive price buys you a computer-designed custom bike frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 
The question for me, a king of the botch job – my terrible handiwork failures litter my house – was about quality. On day one, the boys explain how to select bamboo for strength and how to form strong joints before tubes are glued lightly in place in the workshop: first the front triangle composed of 40 mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more fiddly seat and the chain assembly. Alloy tubes are inserted for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts which require the strength and precise engineering impossible in bamboo. 
All this, together with the technical skill involved in using jigs, power tools and design blueprints, is a leap of faith for someone whose idea of DIY is flatpack furniture assembly. Accurate cutting for a clean joint can be tricky, for example.  James and Ian buzz cheerfully between workbenches, supervising every cut, triple-checking every joint, and will take over if a task seems insurmountable. The self-build is half the attraction for most participants; it may be no coincidence that all those on this course were engineers. For the rest of us, Ian reassures that everyone messes up once or twice. 
No problem – just get another piece and have another go. Such is the benefit of bamboo. Each length has been pre-checked for quality, so you get to indulge in frame aesthetics: plain bamboo, black or mottled.  Sunday is a more relaxed day, mainly spent building the lugs. Or rather, wraps: hemp bindings wrapped around the joints and dropouts then glued with epoxy resin to form a strong bond that disperses loads evenly throughout the frame. With a final polymer coating for waterproofing, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any other individual touches. And it is a bike built for the long haul, just as strong, the pair claim, as its metal equivalents. 
Ian has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, while James has failed to destroy one bike off-road over three months of testing. ‘To be honest, our bikes are over-engineered – we use larger diameter tubes and over-thick bindings – but I prefer it like that,’ James says. 
Technical issues aside, how good does a bamboo bike look? Somewhat scruffy alongside professional frames, it turns out – the hemp weave can look a bit like parcel tape, for example. But there’s no denying their individuality and that, say James and Ian, is the point. 
Personally though, I believe that any bicycle made from this kind of material should be a relaxed affair, something for cruising sedately around on rather than racing. I therefore plump for a frame that avoids the stiff angularity of my existing metal machine: a ‘Classic English’ giving a gentle, easy-going ride.  They also cycle well. I take James’s bike for a spin and the ride is light, stiff and smooth thanks to bamboo’s ability to dampen vibration. Impressive, considering I target every pothole. ‘Some people love the build, but for me these workshops come together when the bike is on the road,’ James says. ‘They’re so light, so effortless to ride. So much fun to ride too – take a Harley-style retro bike, add 10 and you’re still not close.’ And the price? Less than £500. ",C2
"The Actor’s Craft

Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova’s reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: ‘If I could tell you,’ she said, ‘I wouldn’t dance it.’ But instead they all too easily fall into ponderous clichés, silly truisms or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. We should all pay heed to what Paul Scofield said in a letter to a friend of mine: ‘I have found that an actor’s work has life and interest only in its execution. It seems to wither away in discussion and become emptily theoretical and insubstantial. It has no rules (except perhaps audibility). With every play and every playwright the actor starts from scratch, as if he or she knows nothing and proceeds to learn afresh every time growing with the relationships of the characters and the insights of the writer. When the play has finished its run, he’s empty until the next time. And its the emptiness which is, I find, apparent in any discussion of theatre work.’

A review of Hamlet

Adrian Lester’s Hamlet is poised precariously between boyhood and manhood, and it is a performance of thrilling simplicity and assurance. His handling of the text and his physical and psychological self-control take him, in one leap, from brilliantly promising to frontline player: an actor with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing. Lester plays an edgy, tetchy young man who feeds on a banked-down sense of anger, agile, watchful and driven, he deploys a sense of acid wit and generous humour that makes him both formidable and lovable. Although played down, the virtuosity of this performance is unmistakable. Observe Lester’s body, the way his arms hang stiffly, giving you a sense of a figure waiting to be animated. Handy’s portrayal of Horatio gives you a similar feeling of a body being moved by an inner force that he both knows and does not know. So what is acting? What is behaviour? Is the former an imitation or an evocation of the latter? Who and what animates these bodies, morally and physically? That is the central question about the life of the theatre.

One director’s approach to rehearsal

The first stage of this director’s rehearsal process is known as ‘dropping in', a procedure which goes something like this. The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, finding out what effect the words are having. When if is their turn to speak, they glance of the screen, digest the first phrase, think about what it means to them, wait to find the impulse - the reason to speak - then speak. For example, the line is, ‘Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?; Breathe. Let the thought drop in with your breath. A memory, a vision, an impression. Some people will imagine a queue, maybe at a bus stop on the way to rehearsals or for a rock concert in their youth. Having visualised the scene, find the impulse to speak it - what this director calls ‘The pathway to the line'. Impulses can come from without or within. Look in the eyes of the other actor listening. Consider your character's situation. This director talks of ‘dropping in' as a means of finding out what is going on. Don’t pre-plan or pre-judge. Dare to go down there with an empty mind and trust that something will happen to you.

The Perfect Theatre

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. Going to the theatre, going to any live performance, is an event and the staff need to have a sense of that, too. It’s terribly alienating if you feel that its just any old job for the people working front of house.
The theatre itself needs to create a relationship between the performer and the audience - no one in the audience should feel that they’re getting an unreasonably prejudiced view of the actor. It's important that they’re not too far away, they can hear, they can see, they can feel in some sense in contact with what’s going on on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there’s something wrong with it because you can’t deny the human form at the heart of drama. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage.
I like theatres that have a sense of the past in them. Like worn stone steps in a church, you get the sense of layers of human presence. From the point of view of the plays, you can’t have something for everybody. You cant second-guess an audience because they don’t know what they're going to want to see. When you visit the theatre, you want something done in a way you can’t imagine, otherwise you may as well have stayed at home.",C2
"CRYING 

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance, with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears, at least during childhood, are mainly an expression of helplessness. However, the persistence of crying into adulthood is harder to explain. It seems that the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. 
Tears can undoubtedly have other causes too. We may cry to express sympathy for those suffering terrible injustice. Furthermore, tears can be shed involuntarily, rather to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may cry when watching a sentimental film, but interestingly, this is more likely to occur in company than when we are alone. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues.

"Every Picture Tells a Story

Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction, condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs. I do not mean ‘redundancy' in the usual colloquial sense of material which is unnecessary, but in a technical sense.
In a novel, such redundancy would include the repeated allusion to certain traits by which characters are identified, as well as speech tags such as ’he said’. Strictly speaking a character trait needs to be described only once, but it assists comprehension if we are constantly reminded of it. And usually we can infer who is speaking in a scene of dialogue from the content and layout on the page, but speech tags make reading easier.
Stage drama, which consists mostly of speech, imitates and reproduces the redundancy of real speech with various degrees of stylisation. In some modern dramas, this is taken to an extreme, so that the dialogue seems to consist almost entirely of redundant language, whose function is purely phatic (merely establishing contact between the two speakers), leaving us in the dark as to what is being communicated.

Watching Movies

Watching movies, one can be carried away to the degree that one feels part of the world of the moving picture. It is an experience that lifts one out of oneself into a world where one is not beholden to ordinary reality, at least for the length of the film. So it seems that what one feels and does while at the movies does not really count.
But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is abruptly broken, one is again in the ordinary world. One does not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents one from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in my boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'. This was how some people of our parents' generation, and most of our teachers, disparaged the movies. Like most people, they liked to be entertained, but they did not consider the movies to be an art.

The film studios

The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a huddle of many disparate buildings. The topography of the place was irrational and obscure. It possessed, certainly, a few permanent landmarks such as the Script Department, out for the rest it appeared to be made up of numerous small rooms, identically furnished, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations and could be distinguished one from another only by a surrealist system of digits and letters of the alphabet, and to locate any particular one of these unaided was a considerable enterprise. More than anything else, perhaps, the studio lacked a focus. A decisive single main entrance might have provided this, but in fact there were three main entrances, severely egalitarian in their amenities and with nothing to choose between them except that one of them gave access to the place where you wanted to arrive and the other two did not; and in none of them was there anywhere where enquiries could be made and some species of orientation established. To the mere stranger it was all vastly confusing.
Mere strangers, however, were few and far between; for obvious reasons, the organisation did not encourage their presence. And it was to be presumed that people who worked there could find their way about all right. And by these employees’ united labours, romance and adventure would travel the country. Hand in hand, head against shoulder, Jane and George, Sally and Dick would, for three hours at least, snatch immunity, by the studio's contriving, from domestic contention and public strife, from tedium and malice and routine, and the struggle to keep alive.

Film-makers

Almost everybody, it seems, wants to make a movie. Bookshops fill shelves with ‘how-to' books about scriptwriting and film production. Fashionable universities offer courses. There are competitions offering the kind of hand-held camera that Robert Rodriguez used to make the film El Mariachi, which cost $7,000 to make and shot him from nowhere into the front line of American independent directors. If ever dreams came true, they did for Rodriguez - and ahead of schedule. Recalling his 23rd birthday in his book about his Mariachi adventures, he writes: “Orson Welles made Citizen Kane when he was 25. Spielberg made Laws at 26. So I’ve only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film.’
This was not always so. When the studios ruled, film-makers were expected to take time to mature. They worked behind the scenes, as editors, writers or cinematographers. They learnt the job directing low-budget Westerns or supporting short films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, The Maltese Falcon. Fred Zinnemann, the director of High Noon, only got into his stride in his forties. But nowadays, without the support system of studios or television, aspiring film-makers are forced to be mavericks.",C2
"Kinetic Art

Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not, thankfully, by some huge-budget, mega-hyped, multi-media extravaganza, but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century. In the process, it reveals that making artworks which either move by themselves or investigate the idea of movement in some way has been a consistent if largely unrecognised theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. And not only that — the marvellous range of paintings and drawings, documents and films on kinetic art assembled by curator Guy Brett, who has made a life-long study of the subject, are presented largely unmediated by text. Visitors, unharried by explanations, are left to have the pleasure of making connections and discoveries for themselves.

David Hockney

Hockney’s work appeals to a great many people who might otherwise display little interest in art. It may be that they are attracted to it because it is figurative and, therefore, easily accessible on one level, or because the subject matter of leisure and exorcism provides an escape from the mundanities of everyday life. Perhaps it is not even the art that interests some people, but Hockney’s engaging personality and the verbal wit that makes him such good copy for the newspapers. He may, in other words, be popular for the wrong reasons. But does this negate the possibility that his art has a serious sense of purpose?
In the view of some respected critics, Hockney is nothing more than an overrated minor artist. To this one can counter that Hockney might seem minor because it is unacceptable today to be so popular, rather than because his work is lacking in substance. Hockney himself is not self-deluding; he is aware of his limitations and thinks that it is beside the point to dismiss his work because it does not measure up to an abstract concept of greatness. Hockney does not claim to be a great artist and is aware that only posterity can form a final judgement on his stature.

Window-shopping - an art exhibition

In the last few years I have seen loads of exhibitions of contemporary art, and amongst them brilliance and mediocrity. What always bugs me, though, are shows that seem to push an underlying agenda, suggesting there is a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes it works, we really are made aware of new trends mining though apparently unrelated work. More often, though, we are alerted to a dubious angle or a forced concept. This led me, as a curator, to attempt a show which stands as an antithesis to this.
Together with seven artists I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ‘Window-shopping’ was intended as a collection of individual artworks that related to each other purely through the fact that they proclaimed to be art. Sam Cole’s knitted cats went barmy chasing each other round on a toy train track. In contrast Matthew Crawley’s turning on a video camera, opening it up and poking around in there until it breaks flickered, flashed and disappeared on the monitor in the corner. These works certainly didn’t fit into the ‘an exhibition exploring the theme of …’ category, and wouldn’t usually be seen together in the same show, but why not? They did not impede each other and actually, I hope, through their contrast, gave something to each other. OK, so I haven’t made any grandiose statements about the nature of contemporary art practice, but there probably aren’t any to be made about what is basically an individual activity in which artists set their own parameters.

Art History

People who enjoy paintings are sometimes reluctant to analyse them for fear of spoiling the richness and spontaneity of their experience. It has been suggested that some of the work done by art historians, whose concern is with theory rather than practice, ignores and indeed denies the aesthetic experience, the fundamental pleasure of looking, as well as the very special act of artistic creativity. This view is a bit like the notion that knowing the ingredients of the recipe, recognising the method of cooking and seeing the utensils employed detracts from the taste of the dish.
Acknowledging the importance of enjoying something does not, of course, preclude a thorough knowledge of the object that is arousing pleasure. It might in fact be more pleasurable if we know more about the object we are viewing. Moreover, pleasure is not a simple matter. The arousal of our senses - and how we recognise and register it - is itself open to interrogation. It is also historically located. Why we like particular characteristics of certain sorts of objects at any one time is not simply the result of our genes or our own particular personalities but is determined by values promoted within the society of which we are a part. So, while no one seeks to underestimate the importance of sensuous and instinctive responses to art objects, the notion that the sensuous is undermined by the intellectual is a legacy from a period in the past which promoted art as an alternative to thought.",C2
"Vervet monkeys

Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. If he succeeded, it was more than likely that the incumbent male would be ousted from his position of privilege. With the vervet equivalent of a stroke of genius, the male hit on the ideal ploy to keep the stranger away from his group. As soon as the strange male descended from the grove of trees to try to cross the open ground that separated his grove from the one in which the group was feeding, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to signal the sighting of a leopard nearby. The stranger shot back into the safety of his trees. As the day wore on, this was repeated every time the stranger made a move in the groups direction. All was going swimmingly until the male made a crucial mistake: after successfully using the ploy several times, he gave the leopard alarm call while himself nonchalantly walking across open ground.

What Cats Catch

In a recent survey, people in the 173-household English village of Felmersham collected their cats’ prey. Over one year their seventy cats produced over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America saw these figures and worked out that on this basis the cat population of Britain must be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year!
The mesmeric effect of big numbers seems to have stultified reason. It is not realistic just to multiply the number of catches of these rural cats by the entire cat population of Britain. Most cats are town cats with small ranges, and catch fewer items of prey than the cats in this survey. The key question should have been this: are the numbers sustainable? The answer would seem to be yes.
In winter many householders feed birds, while garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, and in this way the bird population is kept at well above 'natural' levels. The survey found that the cat is a significant predator, but not that it is devastating Britain’s bird population.

Buffalo’s Day

The buffaloes are, as it were, the marshman’s lifeline, and they are cherished accordingly. At each dawn the buffaloes, who have been sleeping on the buffalo platform or quite frequently round the fire with their owners, leave, infinitely slowly and wearily, their wallowing progress continually punctuated with despairing groans, for the distant reed beds beyond the open water. For a long time they stand on the edge of the platform, groaning to each other of the infinite fatigue of the coming day, until at last the leader takes a ponderous pace forward and subsides into the water.
Once in the water a deep lassitude once more descends upon the party, as if they had by now forgotten their intention and they may wallow there with low notes of complaint for many minutes. The movements that at length remove them from the immediate vicinity of the house are so gradual as to pass practically unnoticed, but finally they are swimming, so low in the water that their noses seem held above it by a last effort of ebbing strength, their rolling eyes proclaiming that this is the end at last and that they are drowning. So, patient and protesting and more or less submerged, they spend the day among the reeds and the bulrushes, grazing leisurely upon such green shoots as their antediluvian heads may find at eye level.

PICASSO, Pablo 

The soles 1940 Oil on canvas Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art

Picasso tended to paint those things that surrounded him, and in the early spring of 1940, he painted several fish still lifes while he was staying in the fishing port of Royan. The ostensible subject of the painting is a fishmonger's slab with a crab, and a pair of scales containing two or three soles. In spite of their predicament these sea creatures look very much still alive. It is not very easy to read the painting because Picasso has treated the composition in terms of a flat pattern of overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. This, the thin delicately brushed paint, and the cool, undemonstrative colours give the painting the appearance of an underwater world of slow-moving calm and harmony. But this is disturbed by what seems to be an impending battle between the fish, baring their teeth, and the crab, with its open claws. Those sharp, pointed forms are echoed by the scales. Even the chain going round one of the fish takes on a more sinister aspect. There is an undercurrent of menace and barely suppressed violence that gives the picture a symbolic edge.

"Music - The Challenge Ahead

Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work, at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain.

In the latter part of the 20th century, we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. Along with this, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians.
There seems little doubt that the widening access to music is likely to continue, fulfilling as it does so many human needs. On a national level, no major state occasion is without music. For individuals, it provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal.
Indeed, a society without music is surely unthinkable and it seems that the issue is not whether there will be music in the 21st century but what the nature of that music will be, and also whether there will be a continued perceived need for people to learn to play musical instruments.
I would respond to the latter question on a positive note. The music industry is one of the major generators of income in Britain and musical skill and talent will continue to be important in preparing individuals to work in a variety of professions, in particular those related to the media.
In addition to its vocational significance, there is a growing body of evidence that playing an instrument may be beneficial to the development of skills at an earlier stage. Research in the USA has suggested that listening to or actively making music has a direct positive effect on spatial reasoning, one aspect of the measurement of intelligence.
While these results are still to be successfully replicated, other data from Europe has indicated that an increase in group music lessons can have positive effects on social relationships in school and on concentration in young children and those with behavioural difficulties.
Taking the idea behind such findings one step further, current research is investigating to what extent playing an instrument may even encourage the development of transferable skills. For instance, the need to practise regularly may assist in the acquisition of good study habits and focused concentration, playing in concerts may encourage habits of punctuality and good organisation.
For all these reasons, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. What about the longer term picture? Is there likely to be a shift in focus and, if so, what direction will it take?
While there are many possible scenarios, I believe that two possibilities are likely. Firstly, the kinds of music to which people will listen will become more diverse. New genres will develop which will integrate different styles. Secondly, there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. This will widen access to composition as there will be less reliance on technical skill but at the same time, it is likely to further reduce the need for live performance and musicians whose role is solely related to it.
Developing in parallel with this trend is a likely increase in the number of people, across the whole age range, who wish to actively participate in music making. Such activities are likely to be community based and will reflect the musical traditions of that community whatever they may be.
If this vision of the future is to be realised, what does the music profession need to do in preparation? The focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. 
As a result, the impact on the instrumental curriculum and the measures used to assess progress through it will be such that they will need to adapt to maintain their relevance for a broader sector of the population. Ultimately, they will need to encompass a wider range of musical skills.
Crucial to the success of the process will be the training of musicians. They will need to be able to motivate, inspire and teach learners of all ages, develop skills for working with large and diverse groups and acquire the communication, social, entrepreneurial and management skills necessary for community work.
This represents a fundamental change from traditional practice and it will be accompanied by the need to respond to demands for public accountability. Viewed positively, this should provide an opportunity for all those involved in music education to demonstrate the high quality of music tuition available.
Finally, we need to strive towards raising the profile of music itself. Music plays a crucial role in our lives but all too often it is taken for granted. Those involved in the music profession at all levels need to work actively together to ensure that this changes.

"Fashion

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out, though, that fashion, at least in the sense of style and design, has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point.
As societies have developed in complexity, populations have expanded, and multiple technologies for producing an increasing variety of clothing and physical adornment have been discovered, so the meanings attached to dress have also increased in their complexity and significance. Consequently, it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty today what any item of clothing or adornment actually means. For example, a man’s suit, supposedly an indicator of the most extreme uniformity, actually conveys very differing meanings in different contexts and to different people.

Writer

Newspaper reports of publishers in bidding wars over whizz-kid manuscripts have resulted in a skewed idea of what life is like for your average novelist. Down at my end of the business - i.e. not exactly topping the best-seller lists - there are two ways of making ends meet. The wisest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if the book doesn’t immediately get snapped up and turned into a film. Those such as myself, however, are literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a bit of teaching, the occasional workshop and articles like this. I have heard tell of an in-house writing opportunity offered by a chocolate factory, but I’ve never managed to get anything like that. Somehow, though, by dint of juggling part-time jobs and credit cards and also, more often than not, thanks to the generosity of those names you find in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

Sudden Fame

The small venues we were performing at around the country were all beginning to sell out and extra bouncers were having to be called in to hold back the growing legion of screaming girls. We found ourselves having to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms we were playing to prevent ourselves being mobbed by fans. On the few nights a week when we were not working, we found it difficult to leave the house without being pursued through the streets by adoring followers. In a matter of days, we had been transformed into celebrities. Our moves were monitored by our admirers and all of our needs catered for by our management and other interested parties. Even though the shyness that had always accompanied me never quite went away, it was replaced by a strange naive over-confidence that only naturally shy people who have been thrust into similar situations can relate to. In short, I was emotionally totally out of my depth.",C2
"The two sisters kept Lily’s driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement), before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. Chen, however, was actually amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. ‘So you can really drive it then, Lily? Well done!’
Men were strange creatures, Mui thought. Brother-in-law should have been upset about this. Yet he was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. This was the slackest day of the week, they decided to leave early in the morning and return by midday. That way they need lose no customers. In the meantime Lily would practise around the allotments.
Resolved to go along with the majority despite her personal misgivings, Mui had been to buy a road-map. She had been able to get a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, though Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui’s lack of faith in her navigating abilities.
Within an hour of stepping over the newspapers and out of the front door, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, one hand on the cross-braces of Man Kee’s rompers as he pressed his nose against the window, had to grant this. On the road Lily had actually overtaken a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve and such timing that Mui had pressed her lips closely together against her own protest. Chen went as far as applauding.
Now, after coming through the gasworks of this seaside town (reassuring, familiar sight), past the lagoon and its miniature motor boats, they were moving smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the sea front which was full of empty bays.
She was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away. Or even being served with a summons. Might this evidence of basic prudence set Mui’s mind at rest? On the way down Lily had several times observed her elder sister’s taut face in the driving mirror, which she used with great frequency. Perhaps it would be best not to put worries in Mui's mind which would not have occurred to her in the first place. Lily personally locked all the van doors and meticulously tested each in turn.
‘Don't worry,’ Chen joked. ‘No one will want that heap of tin.’ The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances.
Taken aback, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the two sisters to look at the grey barbarian sea. He perched Son on the top railing and put his arms around his stomach. Man Kee was a soft, warm, and what was more, these days an increasingly responsive bundle. He reacted by putting his hand, a tiny replica of the shape of Chen’s, with its broad palm and stubby fingers, on his father’s sleeve.
And it was in that moment that Chen resolved to bring Son up his way. He would have an education in figures (Chen’s own weak point) and grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience in all aspects of the trade on the way. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee’s career.
There was a trail of smoke just before the horizon met the sea in a thin line and then, suddenly shimmering in the glitter of the rising morning sun on the metal waves, a hull; and in a small cute of the railings was a grey telescope. The sparkle of the water instantly altered Chen’s mood.
He put a coin in the slot and trained the glass on the ship. He was unable to find it at first, although he had aimed off carefully with the gun-sight on top of the barrel. Chen swung the tube in wide circles. There it was! Gone again. Chen swivelled the instrument more carefully. Now he had it in the centre of the circle, surprisingly large, red, and very rusty with a small bow wave: tramp steamer.
Chen lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ‘Do you see the ship, Son?’ he asked softly. ‘It is a special little ship for people like us, Son. It is very little and very old but that is only what strangers see. We know better, don't we, Son, because it is the ship that will take us all back home when we are finished here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen.’
Chen kissed the top of Man Kee’s head. Behind him now were Lily and Mui. Lily put her arm round Husband’s shoulders. ‘The little old ship,’ said Chen. ‘Let your mother see, Son.’
Man Kee would not be parted from the telescope and when he had been persuaded to relinquish his grip the whirring inside the mounting had stopped and all Lily could see was a quivering opaque circle of white light with a scratched surface. By the time Chen had found a second coin the ship was over the horizon and Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake.",C2
"I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals, and I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I suppose that by the exercise of invention I could fill the gaps plausibly enough and so make my narrative more coherent; but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know.
To save embarrassment to people still living I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving, and I have in other ways taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.
I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I never kept notes of what was said on this or the other occasions, but I have a good memory for what concerns me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words they faithfully represent, I believe, what was said. I remarked a little while back that I have invented nothing but I have taken the liberty that historians have taken to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard. I have done this for the same reasons that the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted. I want to be read and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make my book readable. The intelligent reader will easily see for himself where I have used this artifice, and he is at perfect liberty to reject it.
Another reason that has caused me to embark upon this work with apprehension is that the persons I have chiefly to deal with are of another culture. It is very difficult to know people and I don’t think one can ever really know any but one’s own countrymen. For men and women are not only themselves; they are also the region in which they were born, the city apartment or the farm in which they learnt to walk, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed and the poets they read. It is all these things that have made them what they are, and these are the things that you cant come to know by hearsay, you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you cannot know persons of a nation foreign to you except from observation, it is difficult to give them credibility in the pages of a book. I have never attempted to deal with any but my own countrymen, and if I have ventured to do otherwise in short stories it is because in them you can treat your characters more summarily. You give the reader broad indications and leave him to fill in the details. In this book, I do not pretend that my characters are as they would see themselves; they are seen, as is my main character, through my own eyes.",C2
"0ral History

The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian’s social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia (‘times were good then’), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, that is, in how the nerves, muscles and sense organs are coordinated to produce complex behaviour. Those taking the ‘whole animal’ approach, although they are often interested in the mechanisms of ‘behaviour’, study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Within the ‘whole animal’ approach, a distinction is often made between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists have traditionally worked in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists have been more concerned with the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals, often in their wild habitats. Although this distinction still exists to some extent, there is now a fruitful coming together of the two.
Among these types, it is the physiologists who like to emphasise that their methods are the more fundamental. However, even if we knew how every nerve cell operated in the performance of some pattern of behaviour, this would not remove the need for us to study it at a behavioural level also. Behaviour has its own organisation and its own units mat we must use for its study. Trying to describe the nest-building behaviour of a bird in terms of the actions of individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a page of a book with a high-powered microscope.

The Social Sciences

A problem facing all students who come to study a social science for the first time is that they must do two things simultaneously. They must familiarise themselves with the substance or content of their new subject and, at the same time, they must learn the methodology of the subject. That is, they must become familiar not only with the knowledge and research findings which fill the textbooks but also with the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised, that is with the logical basis of the subject itself. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related. Because we are all familiar with social life through our everyday experiences we may feel that the social sciences are very largely a matter of common-sense. But, as a look at any textbook will quickly indicate, though each of the social sciences is concerned with people in society, each discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, each uses particular methods of study and each employs its own set of concepts. It is this set of concepts, the most basic ideas in a subject, which constitutes the ‘logical basis of the subject’, which enables the social scientist to go beyond everyday common-sense and which distinguishes one discipline from another.

Classical Architecture

To the classical world, that of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings. ‘Architecture’, says the Roman architect Vitruvius, ‘consists of Order, and of Arrangement, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Propriety and Distribution.’ For several of these terms he gives a Greek equivalent: his definitions probably derived from an earlier Greek authority whose writings are lost to us. Utility and Function are not part of this definition, though in his book Vitruvius does go on to describe the best form and arrangements for different purposes of structure; but here, at the beginning, the aesthetic emphasis, architecture as an art, has priority. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was obviously a long prehistory of basic construction, of hut habitations simple in form and material, both in Greece and Italy, which did not match up to Vitruvius’ artistic requirements. Though these were, by definition, inartistic they nevertheless contributed an essential element of form, which persisted into the later sophisticated architectural concepts. However orate it may appear from the outside, in essence the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.",C2
"How to Write Poetry

Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day, but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. Setting oneself up as a know-all is dangerous, so I have decided to side-step the whole issue by saying that, for someone just beginning to write, no advice can be a substitute for abundant reading, extensive writing, and the freeing of the imagination and spirit in whatever way seems fruitful, barring total anarchy. Some people need their life to be reasonably secure before a poem will come; others can write their way out of misery. Some write to a timetable: others wait for some moment of crystallisation, a brainwave or slow dawning. All are right, providing they are not echoing some prescriptive score. And it’s this finding of a tune which is important, hearing the still small voice inside yourself and feeding it, and watering it, and letting it out for air from time to time; one day it’ll be old enough to take care of itself.

The Short Story

In the short story there is no room for overcrowding with too many characters, slabs of lengthy narrative, prolonged reminiscence or retrospection. Flashbacks must be fleeting, and only used if there is no other way to throw light on an issue. One effective way to do this is through a flash of memory in the leading character's mind; the recollection or reminder of an incident or scene, which stirred the current conflict. Such a recollection can get the story on its way or take it a big step forward at a crucial moment, but never at any time must it be allowed to put a brake on the action. In this respect, dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. Two voices in discussion can reveal two sides of a question in far less time than it takes to explain it from only one person’s viewpoint. It also avoids unnecessary wordage and holds or increases a reader’s interest. Overwriting can kill a short story from the start, but this doesn't mean that brevity must reduce it to the level of a synopsis. Conflict and action must be as well sustained in a short story as in a novel, but in the short story the art lies in making every word count in a compact space.

Screenplays

Anyone who knows how to play chess will understand how to write a screenplay for a film. Most chess players stumble from beginning to end. We don’t know much, but we know enough to play. We move without really knowing what’s going to happen further on in the game. Maybe we can see one or two moves ahead, and, if we can, were pleased by our uncanny ability to see even that far ahead. Better than the days when we couldst see ahead at all - when we were playing blindly.
Over time, as we learned more about playing chess, we made a startling revelation: chess depends more upon long-term strategy than upon short-term tactics. Up till then, we’d been happy with a rather short-sighted approach. Suddenly, we became aware of ‘the big picture’. We began to see the game as a whole, not just a series of individual moves. And once we saw the game as a whole, we began to see patterns emerge in the play. Gambits, they call them. And the patterns have names, such as openings, middle games and end games. In chess, as in screenplay writing, the more often you play, the more aware you become of its complexities.

Looking at Writing

‘Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew, or write’. More than a century ago, Charles Darwin got it right: language is a human instinct, but written language is not. Language is found in all societies, present and past. Although languages change, they do not improve: English is no more complex than the languages of Stone Age tribes; modern English is not an advance of Old English. All healthy children master their language without lessons or corrections. When children are thrown together without a usable language, they invent one of their own. Compare all this with writing.
Writing systems have been invented only infrequently in history. They originated only in a few complex civilisations and they started off code and slowly improved over the millennia. Until recently, most children never learned to read or write; even with today’s universal education, many children struggle and fail. A group of children is no more likely to invent an alphabet than it is to invent the internal combustion engine. Children are wired for sound, but print is an optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on. We need to understand how the contraption called writing works, how the minds of the children work, how to get the two to mesh.",C2
"Metals

It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river, waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw, or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It did not have the feel of stone, but it was attractive. In such a way, one could conjecture that gold entered the lives of primitive people.
Given the malleability of the metal, it very soon became a much sought-after material. Copper may also have been discovered by accident, and once the value of copper tools was realised, the search for its ores and for ways of getting the copper out of them was pursued with vigour. Thus, metalworking was added to our ancestors’ battery of life-enhancing accomplishments.

St Ives

There was silence as we lugged our bags down the winding, cobbled lane that led to the heart of town, bent double against the force eight gale and trying in vain to avoid the icy waves that smashed over the promenade. There was no one on the streets and the shutters in every cottage on the waterfront were bolted tight against the battering. We had watched the weather worsen as we chugged into St Ives on the tiny single-track railway. As the ominous grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season - without a car - no longer seemed such a good idea. I had lured my friend into joining me with the promise of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast, and snug evenings, toasting ourselves before open fires.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again, perhaps we can.
Computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric landscapes and environments and populate them with virtual communities - digital creations with some of the needs, independence and capabilities of real-world humans. We can establish rules of conduct and replicate social units. Then we can turn down the rainfall - or turn up the population - and watch how this cyber-culture and its artificial people react.",C2
"Holiday reading

Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match. What was shy and confused within us is unapologetically and cogently phrased in them, a congruence all the more striking if the work was written by someone in a far-flung place or in another age. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. 

Author’s Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then ‘ecotourism’ would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets. Then the thought that these pages were not a guidebook persuaded me that it didn’t matter very much, so I let the story tell itself free of debilitating caveats.",C2
"REMOVAL DAY

With her children now grown, widowed Susan faces leaving the family home.

The van said, Susan noticed, ‘Removers of Distinction’, and indeed, every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man, his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables, and his team of helpers, not so gentle.
It was a lovely house that she was leaving, an elegant four-storeyed building overlooking a tiny harbour. The years she had spent there, the years of the children growing up and leaving, hung around in the air, faintly present like agitated dust. 
When told that they had bought this house, Robert, then five, had asked thoughtfully, ‘Mum, when you buy a house, how d’you get it home?’ You could miss a little boy in the physical presence of the adult he had become; Robert was here, helping, and in particular making sure she didn’t let on about the piano. Francesca was here too, also helping, in her bossy way, stubbornly certain that nobody but she, the family daughter, would be careful enough over a fine instrument like a Steinway piano.
‘She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry on us,’ observed Fred. ‘That’s something.’ ‘Do people cry?’ Susan asked, intrigued. ‘You'd be surprised,’ said Fred. ‘They go around merry as magpies helping out till its all in the van, then you look round and there they are, crying in the middle of an empty room. They're fine when we get to the new place, mind. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.’
She could easily imagine.
Left to herself, Susan would have warned the removers about the piano before accepting the estimate. Robert had said sternly that it was their business to see the problem, and their bad luck if they didn’t. The piano now stood in solitary glory in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would leave it till last, naturally. Sitting on the bottom stair, for all the chairs were gone now, she remembered the time they had arrived.
The day she was living through now was like that day filmed and run backwards - the piano had been carried in first. And it had got stuck on the stairs. For nearly two hours the team of removal men struggled manfully with it, until it seemed they would simply have to give up.
They brought it up to the turn of the stairs, and down again, and cut out banister rails, and got it jammed anyway, while little Robert looked on enthralled, and young Francesca wailed, ‘We can’t live in a house without a piano! We can’t! I’d rather die!’ And of course they couldn’t, not with a musical daughter destined to be a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it in, and a way had been found.
Peter, her late husband, had come home to the crisis and had resolved it. The piano had been left in the garden while the other furniture was brought in - there was much less of it then, they had been relatively young and hard up. And next day, to everyone’s surprise, a builder had been engaged to take out the first floor window.
Then, from the quay below the house, where fish were unloaded from the inshore boats, a little crane was borrowed, and dragged up the hill by means of the local farmer’s tractor. Finally, the piano was wrapped in blankets, hooked to the crane and gently swung safely through the gaping window, while the entranced children danced with joy at the sight of it.
However, the whole process had cost so much it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned. ‘That’s that,’ Peter had said. ‘That’s there for ever.’ But for ever is a long time.
The children were increasingly too busy to come home at weekends, and Susan was no longer so mobile in the house, and puffing as she climbed the stairs. The thought of the stairs interrupted her daydream. The banister rails were still not quite parallel, they had not been put back perfectly all that time ago. She ought to have warned the removers, surely she ought. But now it was too late. Any moment now they would find it. She looked around, dazed and panic-stricken.
‘Are you all right, love?’ Fred was saying. ‘Mind yourself, it’s just the piano to come now, and then we’ll be on our way.’ She moved from the bottom stair, heart beating. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing in the back of the hallway to watch. ‘No tears then?' Fred said, conversationally.
Truth to tell she was just on the edge of them. How odd that simply moving things made them matter. Chairs and cups and things, hundreds of things, that one never noticed or gave a moment’s thought to while they stayed put, now they were displaced, were full of pathos, crying out to be cared about - and she would have cried, in a moment, surely she would.
Only just then the piano appeared, lurching at the top of the stairs, with Fred backing down in front of it and one of the others behind. It tipped slightly. ‘Easy does it!’ cried Fred, and they carried smoothly down the stairs and out of the front door, and put it down behind the removal van on the road.
It was Robert who laughed first, but then they couldn't stop laughing, relieved that it was all over. All three of them, helplessly, leaning against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. ‘What’s the joke, then?’ asked Fred, but he merely started them off again. So that, as they went, the three of them, arm in arm down the path for the last time, the only tears she shed were tears of laughter.",C2
"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark, motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day. When he had first bought the flat, he used to come home in an eager, questioning mood - often as early as he could — wondering what it had been doing during the hours he had been away. It had represented a form of welcome to him, a region in which his focus was undisputed and reliable. He supposed that he should have worried about intruders or burst drains in that moment of reunion, but his flat had always been sitting waiting for him with an expression of independence or of neglect, depending on whether he’d left it tidy or not. In the end he had begun to regard it merely as another cloistered annexe of himself, a space into which the stuffy chambers of his heart and head had gradually overspilled their contents.
He had grown impatient with its inability to be transformed. There was, of course, the small, angular puddle of letters which sometimes gathered by the door and the red eye of the answering machine which could occasionally be found resuscitated and blinking with life when he returned. And he was grateful that the glassy eyes of his windows hadn’t been smashed nor the contents ravished with violence, mind you, he wondered what the flat would look like afterwards.
From the dreary distance of his shabby third-floor office on the Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four solitary evenings at home each week. Once he had fled the fabricated world of the office and felt the memory of himself begin patchily to return on his bus journey home, he no longer needed to be on his own, a fact which seemed continually to elude him in his social calculations. Sitting exposed at his desk he would crave isolation, unlimited time alone amongst his possessions, but the relief of escape drained him and he would vainly wait for some sense of selfhood to return. Instead, there was merely a resounding emptiness, which made him suspect during his long hours of loneliness that the alien exercise of doing work which did not suit him had forced him to change, moving him further and further from what he liked to think of as himself. He would often read or listen to music as the night deepened outside, familiar habits which now, however, he would find himself asking for whom or what he did them. His points of reference had grown dim, his signposts muddied: sensations and ideas would arrive and then get lost, circulating around the junctions of his mind, unable to find a connection.
There had been a time, he supposed, when he had not felt this powerless, when, had he but perceived his own worth, he might have escaped; but he had been so eager to fix himself up with something that he had been swept along by this great desire for something, and he had followed the first course which presented itself as if it had been ordained that he should do so.
He had tried, of course, after he left university, to formulate some plan for his own betterment, but it hadn’t really surprised him to find, when he searched himself for ambition, merely the desire unobtrusively to survive. He had applied for the types of jobs which had become familiar to him though the talk of his peers, had latched himself wearily on to their futures and jogged behind as they rushed towards them, unable to imagine that he might be put to some use which would manufacture as its by-product his own happiness.
He had attended his only interview gratefully, and in the fever of examination did not think to test the position - an inexplicit editorial role on a free local newspaper for its own merits. Relieved at having pulled off twenty minutes of pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, he had not considered the future of lengthy encounters by which he was now daily assaulted. Neil had offered him the job there and then, telling him he was the only graduate who had applied; a revelation which at the time Ralph had obscurely taken as a compliment.",C2
"Paul Simon

Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult, but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols, who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange, unsettling sound would somehow, irrevocably, be linked with their destinies.
For Paul Simon, as for other youngsters in the US, the chief opportunity for hearing this new and invigorating type of music that was sweeping the country was courtesy of Alan Freed’s radio show, Moondog Rock’n’Roll Party. Freed’s show was required listening for a whole generation of fledgling rock idols. Like the young John Lennon, 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, with his ear glued to Radio Luxembourg - the only European outlet for the new rock and roll - Paul Simon was fascinated by the sounds pouring from Freed’s show, and prepared himself for the next big step for a rock and roll obsessed teenager, the switch from listening to others’ music to making his own.

Snow

No path was visible, but I thought that I would be all right if I walked with due caution. The wind hammered down from the heights, knocking me over as I slid and slithered on the slippery ice. Suddenly the innocent-looking snow gave way beneath me. I dropped, startled, into a hole some four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the gap between two rocks, melting away to leave nothing but a thin crust through which I had plunged. I hauled myself out, shaken and unnerved, wondering what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat back against the top of a pine tree that protruded from the snow to take stock of the situation. In an hour I had covered about half a mile. It was perfectly clear that I would have to abandon my plan.

Qualitative Research

There are now numerous books which attempt to give guidance to researchers about qualitative research. While much has been written about the collection of data, the books are often silent about the processes and procedures associated with data analysis. Indeed, much mystery surrounds the way researchers analyse their data. Accordingly, we invited a range of social scientists who have engaged in qualitative projects to discuss the approaches that they used. The idea was to share insight and understanding of the process of qualitative data analysis rather than to produce a guidebook for the intending researcher. Such a task involves a process of demystification, of making implicit procedures more explicit. While this may sound straightforward, we have found it far from simple. We have therefore given our contributors the opportunity to present their work in a range of styles, which include autobiographical narratives and more impersonal forms.",C2
"'You don't take sugar, do you? shouted his secretary, not so much asking a question as stating a fact - as well she might, because she had been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn’t normally supposed to be there. Actually nowadays he was usually there all the time, having discovered that to take up his proprietorial privilege of staying away was tantamount to opening the floodgates. Not for the first time he pondered the easy, imperceptibly divided stages by which he had progressed from valued counsellor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch at carefully planned planning meetings complete with agenda, to hapless dogsbody moving one step ahead of catastrophe, with nowhere to park when he arrived at work in the mornings.
'This came,' she yelled, vaguely waving a manila folder before putting it down in front of him. 'From that chap in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it.' A typed label said: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.’ Just under that it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see that word 'synopsis’. At the very least he wanted to see a label saying 'A First Draft’. Lancelot had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not really want to see another, however heavily revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given an advance of several thousands of pounds for this book during the initial flurry of activity when Lancelot had bought the firm. One of several old friends from whom Lancelot had made the capital error of commissioning books, Ian Cuthbert was a particularly flagrant proof that in such circumstances the possessor of a wayward temperament, far from nerving himself to behave more predictably for friendship’s sake, will actually become less ‘pindownable’ than ever.
Lancelot skipped the blurb come preamble which he had read for what seemed like the hundredth time and sampled the synopsis proper. There was scarcely a phrase that he did not recognise at a glance. He closed the folder and shifted it to one side. Plainly at this rate Ian’s manuscript would never be forthcoming. As well as almost wholly lacking the brilliance for which its author was supposed to be famous, the synopsis, under its doggedly frolicsome tone, had the unmistakable dead ring of a lost conviction. Lancelot remembered tales of a famous author-about-town whose last book, published incomplete after his death, had been coaxed from him chapter by chapter, one payment at a time. But in that case, the payments were fractions of a hypothetical advance which had never been given in the first place. Ian’s advance had been enormous; a blatant reversal of the sound business principle by which authors must deliver a manuscript now in order to be paid with inflated currency later.
Lancelot, who had read modern languages at Oxford, could remember the day when Ian Cuthbert had been the most promising talent in a Cambridge so full of promise that it had made everywhere else feel provincial. Ian's contemporaries had plotted to take over the British theatre and in a remarkably short time they had actually done so. But their mental energy had seemed like indolence when you looked at Ian. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about what one very famous French writer had said as if he had been there to overhear it. Yet for some reason, the whole frostily coruscating galaxy of Ian's creative intellect had remained locked in its closet. While less gifted deviants came out and conquered, Ian went further in. At the height of his influence as a literary taste-maker he was already notoriously difficult to deal with. Officially appointed by the relevant public agency to edit a comprehensive magazine of the arts, he was like a general with a million tons of equipment pinned down on the beach by nothing except an excess of opportunity. The magazine used up the budget for a dozen issues without appearing once. Similarly, his thrice-renewed three-year contract with one of the fashion magazines engendered little except legends about the size of his emolument, which was increased from generosity to extravagance in an attempt to make him produce more, and then from extravagance to munificence in an attempt to make him produce anything. At the editorial working breakfasts - there were always at least two of the titled photographers present to capture the scene for posterity - Ian spat witty venom through clenched teeth, and poured nitric acid on other people's ideas. Ten years later, he could scarcely be depended upon to turn up for his own funeral. Lancelot was on the verge of admitting to himself that 'A World History of the Short' had been a mistake from its inception.",C2
"Air-conditioning

There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym, a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures, the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so, in fact, that at quiet times, the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. This is just one example of how the modern world casually misuses air-conditioning. It has become a central feature of work and play, a potent symbol of the ability of humanity to control the climate, or at least modify it.
Many air-conditioned buildings, however, could employ other methods of cooling. They could take advantage of daylight and natural ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and radiate it away at night. These measures may sound obvious, but they can have telling results and would considerably reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It is surely more than coincidence that the beginning of a new millennium is being accompanied by renewed interest in sundials: instruments used to measure time according to the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were a vital time-keeping device, essential for anyone who hoped to keep their clocks working accurately. Then, as clocks and watches became more sophisticated and reliable, the sundial was relegated to the status of garden ornament - a romantic and intriguing ornament, but nonetheless an anachronism, in a brave new technological age. Now the clock has been turned back and they are again being taken seriously.
David Harber, a sundial maker, believes that their appeal lies in their direct link with the planets. He says that when he delivers one, there is a moment of magic when it starts working. They are still, calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the cosmos.

Paint Your Own China

My image of china-painting stemmed from a visit, long ago, to an arts and crafts exhibition where stern-looking grey-haired ladies demonstrated how to cover a teacup with delicate flowers using a series of deft brushstrokes. The spectacle was riveting, because each stroke formed a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands never wobbled, the paint never smudged, and the observer might have concluded that these women had either been practising their art for decades or had been born with an extraordinary talent for steady precision.
Mindful of this experience, I wondered what kind of people would have the courage to enrol on a course in china-painting. Would even the beginners display an intuitive artistry? In fact, the atmosphere turned out to be far from intimidating. The students were all there to have fun and not even the tutor wanted to paint petals on teacups with the robotic rapidity I had remembered.",C2
"Philadelphia Avenue

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, the humidity thickened into a palpable, prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness; our neighbours the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer’s grocery store, and the Kring’s and the Pottses’ houses where my first playmates, all girls, lived. These houses down the street, though not every inhabitant was known by name to me, had each been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street, and which punctuated my progress on roller skates or on my scooter. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well: the porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes: wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron, in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. Throughout Shillington, not only had houses I remembered as homes become stores but, stranger still, stores - Pep Conrad’s up on Franklin and Second, Han Kieffer’s here - had reverted to being homes. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?

Bachelor Fads

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert’s flat is a former curtain warehouse. It has the conventional features of the classic loft space, in this instance, exposed brickwork and gigantic doors, through which curtains were once hoisted from trains on the adjacent railway track. But Gilbert was adamant that he didn’t want a brutally empty, open-plan space - for practical as much as aesthetic reasons.
'In my last place, living and working spaces were integrated. It was hard to switch off or start work in full view of the living area.’
Refusing to conform to the loft-dwelling convention of open-plan living, he broke up the space near the entrance with a giant snaking sheet of corrugated plastic. 'It hides the office, creates a hallway, and guides the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral zone, where I can either cook dinner for friends or make coffee for clients.’
To offset the synthetic look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert laid the floors with a light wood. And while his futuristic chairs and sofas litter the flat, its also stuffed with rather more sentimental and homely furniture, given to him by his parents or bought from markets.

Bruce Chatwin

To escape or to explore? The spur behind Bice Chatwin’s absurdly romantic nomadic existence has become something of a literary conundrum. Chatwin's life and art were strewn with secrets, subtle resonances and, it must be said, lies. But he was, for all that, a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, In Patagonia, published in 1977, is an awesome exercise in imagination. A travel book that reinvented travel writing, it has the animation of a thriller, the sparkle of romantic fiction and the irrepressible insight of truly extraordinary literature. Of course, even with this book, Chatwin cloaked fact with concoction; when sketching individuals and incidents, he would adjust, if not abandon, objective reality for the sake of a better twist to an anecdote, or a clean cut to the heart of what the book somehow seemed to suggest - that through travel it was possible to discover whole histories that had been lived out as if solely to excite and fascinate future explorers.

Swimming

The warm rain tumbled from the gutter in one of those midsummer downpours as I hastened across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. Breaststroking up and down, I nosed along, eyes just at water level. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm intensified, drowning birdsong, and a haze rose off the water as though the pool itself were rising to meet the lowering sky.
It was at the height of this drenching in the summer of 1996 that the notion of a long swim through Britain began to form itself. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage.
Most of us live in a world where more and more places and things are signposted, labelled, and officially ‘interpreted’. There is something about all this that is tuning the reality of things into visual reality. It is the reason why walking, cycling and swimming will always be subversive activities. They allow us to regain a sense of what is old and wild, by getting off the beaten track and breaking free of the official version of things. A swimming journey would give me access to that pan of our world which, like darkness, misty woods or high mountains, still retains most mystery.",C2
"AESTHETICS

By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. In common conception, the work of art is often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. Since the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience, the result is not favourable to understanding. In addition, the very perfection of some of these products, the prestige they possess because of a long history of unquestioned admiration, creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When an art product once attains classic status, it somehow becomes isolated from the human conditions under which it was brought into being and from the human consequences it engenders in actual life experience.
When artistic objects are separated from both conditions of origin and operation in experience, a wall is built around them that renders almost opaque their general significance, with which aesthetic theory deals. Art is remitted to a separate realm, where it is cut off from that association with the materials and aims of every other form of human effort and achievement. A primary task is thus imposed upon one who undertakes to write upon the philosophy of the fine arts. This task is to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings that are universally recognised to constitute experience. Mountain peaks do not float unsupported, they do not even just rest upon the earth. They are the earth in one of its manifest operations. It is the business of those who are concerned with the theory of the earth, geographers and geologists, to make this fact evident in its various implications. The theorist who would deal philosophically with fine art has a like task to accomplish.
If one is willing to grant this position, even if only by way of temporary experiment, one will see that there follows a conclusion which is at first sight surprising. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time, to turn aside from them and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. For theory is concerned with understanding and insight. It is, of course, quite possible to enjoy flowers in their coloured form and delicate fragrance without knowing anything about plants theoretically. But if one sets out to understand the flowering of plants, one is committed to finding out something about the interactions of soil, air, water and sunlight that condition the growth of plants. 
In order to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw, in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear, arousing one's interest and affording enjoyment as one looks and listens. Yet so extensive and subtly pervasive are the ideas that set art itself upon a remote pedestal that many people would be repelled rather than pleased if told that they enjoyed their casual recreations, in part at least, because of their aesthetic quality.The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts: for instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events. For, when what they know as art is relegated to the museum and gallery, the unconquerable impulse towards experiences enjoyable in themselves finds such outlet as the daily environment provides. Many people who protest against the museum conception of art still share the fallacy from which that conception springs. For the popular notion comes from a separation of art from the objects and scenes of ordinary experience that many theorists and critics pride themselves upon holding and even elaborating. The times when select and distinguished objects are closely connected with the products of usual vocations are the times when appreciation of the former is most rife and most keen.

"Enough Sleep?

Tiredness, it is often claimed, has become the modern condition. As the richer, busier countries have grown, so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected, and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists, or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.
Part of this interest is in sleep in general: in its rhythms, its uses and in problems with sleeping. But a central preoccupation remains. ‘People need more sleep,’ says one leading sleep researcher. ‘People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.’
Recently, a sleep researcher tried an experiment. He offered his subjects the opposite of the modern routine. ‘I allowed them to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to reach an equilibrium of eight-and-a-quarter hours. That indicates a great rebound of sleep - sleep that they hadn't been getting!’
In Europe, such propositions are perhaps most thoroughly tested in a small unassuming building on a university campus in the English Midlands. The university sleep research laboratory has investigated, among many subjects, the effects of fatigue on sailors, the effects of airpot noise on sleepers, and the dangers of motorway driving for flagging drivers.
For guinea pigs, they advertise in the student newspapers. Subjects are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to adjust their sleeping patterns according to instructions. Dr Louise Reyner provides reassurance: ‘Some people are quite worried, because you’re putting electrodes on their heads, and they think you can see what they’re dreaming or thinking.’
In fact, the laboratory’s interest is more physical. In a darkened room stands a motorway simulator, the front section of car facing a wide projection screen. The subjects are always told to arrive at 2pm, in the body's natural mid-afternoon lull, after a short night’s sleep or no sleep at all. The projector is switched on and they are asked to drive, while answering questions. An endless road rolls ahead, sunlight glares; and the air is warm.
The young men all deny they are going to fall asleep. Dr Reyner has a video recording of one trying not to. At first the person at the wheel is very upright, wet and bleary eyes determinedly fixed on the windscreen. Then he begins to blink briefly, every now and again; then for longer, and more often, with a slight drop of the head. Each nod grows heavier than the last. The blinks become a 10-second blackout. Every time, he jerks awake as if nothing has happened. But the car, by the second or third occasion, has shot off the carriageway.
A coffee might have helped. Two cups, Dr Reyner says, even after no sleep at all, can make you a safe driver for half an hour or more. She recommends a whole basket of alertness products: tablets, energy drinks, caffeinated chewing gum. Shift workers, she is quite sure, could probably use them.
But apart from these findings, what else do know about human sleep with any kind of certainty? It is known that humans sleep, like other mammals, according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness, from stage one sleep, the shallowest, to stage four, the deepest. When dreams occur, which is usually during the lightest sleep, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids, thus preventing injuries.
Beyond this, certainties blur into theories. It is often suggested, for example, that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.
However, there is a strong degree of certainty among scientists that women seep for half an hour longer than men, and that older people require less sleep, though they don’t know why. When asked what sleep is for, some sleep researchers reply in cosmic terms: ‘Sleep is a tactic to travel through time without injury.’
Moreover, people may have had different sleep patterns in the past. A history professor has investigated nocturnal British life between 1500 and 1850 and discovered that sleeping routines were very different. People went to bed at nine or ten, then woke up after midnight, after what they called their ‘first sleep’, stayed awake for an hour, and then had their ‘morning sleep'.
The interlude was a haven for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time thieving. The poorest were the greatest beneficiaries of this quiet time, fleetingly freed from the constraints and labours that ruled their day-time existence.
By the 17th century, however, as artificial light became more common, the rich began to switch to the more concentrated, and economically more efficient, mode of recuperation that we follow today. Two centuries later, the industrial revolution pushed back the dusk for everyone except some country-dwellers, by making most people work longer hours in lighted buildings.
Yet beyond Europe and America, the old pattern was widespread until quite recently, and according to a leading anthropologist, in some non-western settings there are still no rigid bedtimes. People go to bed for a few hours, and then get up again. The idea of a night’s solid sleep does not apply. For certain tribal societies, human and animal noises and the need to supervise the fire and watch out for predators combine to make continuous sleep impossible. It seems that people all round the world are badly in need of sleep.",C2
"Art on TV

Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera, which has the ability to show a whole work of art, then move in close to examine the details. Yet I can think of few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of looking at them.
A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes’s eight part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

Dealing in Metals

For 20 years I worked as an international metals dealer and gained something of a reputation as a speculator. Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it’s possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into allegations made against one of the multinational conglomerates that benefit from these cheap raw materials.

Extract from a Holiday Brochure

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas that stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer, to Cuba. Each one has its own personality, each one has something to offer.
The key to getting anywhere in the islands and cays of Abaco is a boat. If you don’t get one thrown in with the room don’t worry. Be happy. There are ferries galore. And water-taxis. Or, there are plenty of boats to rent if you prefer to go under your own steam.
But sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed ‘The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason.
Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It’s not only at sea that gems can be found. At night it's the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay that sparkle.",C2
"Joanna’s Lessons

Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano?

Even a member of that mythical species, the completely tone deaf, could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Simply to see her zipping around a keyboard grabbing fistfuls of notes at the behest of some unfeasible contemporary score is to watch a pianist pushing the human frame to its limits.
But even her dazzling virtuosity was not enough to was one small boy at a recent concert she gave for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he had been cascaded with bits and bobs of pieces in every style from her vast repertoire of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African, etc. He’d coolly watched her dive under the lid of the concert grand to pluck the wires - normally a surefire knockout for kids. Then as she drew breath and invited questions, he piped up: ‘Can you play Match of the Day?’
How many veterans of the concert hall platform would be floored by such a request? For Joanna MacGregor, though, it was simply a hoot. ’In his eyes, until I played that, I hadn’t passed the test. I wasn’t a proper pianist.’ Needless to say, she sailed through and doubtless logged the experience for her next children’s recital.
MacGregor is rare among top-flight concert pianists for the interest she takes in how young children learn the instrument. She has just published her own elementary piano tutor for children: Joanna MacGregor’s Piano World. And she has managed it despite a crippling work schedule.
There hardly seems to be a festival this summer she is not gracing. Tomorrow she is in the thick of an all-day collaboration between nine young composers and artists. She runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. And by her own admission, she cannot meet an artist of any sort without being tempted to suggest a joint project. So why on earth take on the extra burden of writing a book?
‘People who know me are clearly surprised. But I think the very first lessons are absolutely crucial. It says a lot about the music profession that we tend to concentrate on the top end, on this idea of the child as nascent virtuoso. Most people’s interest in music is much more ordinary and everyday. I find that far more interesting!’
In producing the first three books, MacGregor is drawing on vivid experience. Between the ages of 18 and 25, before she was getting concert engagements as a pianist, she taught a stream of beginners the piano. But most important in her make-up now as a musician who is unsurpassed in the breadth of her eclectic repertoire was the endless procession of small boys and girls traipsing into her childhood home, where her mother taught the piano.
‘Not only was I fiddling around at the keyboard, but there were all these other children of all backgrounds wanting to play every sort of music - bits of classical, jazz, pop, improvisation. I wasn’t part of that hothouse thing of forcing exceptional talent. I grew up with the idea of trying to make music available to people of all abilities.’
Just as everyone should be able to learn how to swim or to speak a smattering of French, so, in her view, should everybody be able to make a stab at learning the piano. Some kids have a flair and make rapid progress. She is fascinated by the others: those who chug along at varying rates of progress, enjoying it for a while, but all too often giving up. This falling off happens at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too frustrating. Others rebel further down the line when the stakes get higher and parental pressure is driving them ‘to be like those children on the telly.’
‘I worry that some people use music, like sport, as a way of making their children achieve things, rather than just saying: it’s music, it's there to enjoy. The reason children fall by the wayside is because they feel they are not going to match up to their parents' expectations.
The production of her own training manual begs an obvious question. Does she have a poor opinion of the existing corpus of tutor books, or indeed of the general quality of piano teaching? ‘I’m very reluctant to criticise other people’s teaching or others’ tutor books,’ she says. What she does do is readily accept that her books, colourful and eye-catching though they are, are by no means the only books on the market designed to make the first steps enjoyable.
Her own special wheeze for luring these neophytes, the fives, sixes and sevens, through those bewildering times is to weave a storyline into the books and their accompanying CDs. The challenge at this fragile stage is to make the work interesting. And so, from lesson one, there are accompaniments in a variety of styles for teacher - or parent - to play beneath a child’s line. For kids whose parents aren’t pianists the accompaniments are recorded on the CDs. Learning should be unadulterated fun, MacGregor insists.
‘You have to allow them to improvise and give them a reason to play at either end of the keyboard and on the black notes and use the pedals.’ As progress is made, bigger obstacles loom. Children need to be coaxed quite hard to read the music rather than rely on ear. Having relied for so much of her own childhood on her very keen ear, MacGregor has considerable sympathy on this score.
But she believes the single most important factor is practice. How can children be persuaded to play a passage even once again, let alone many times over? She admits to not having practised rigorously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she began building up a contemporary repertoire whose formidable difficulties demanded practice. Now she loves it. The eight hours a day that she gets through are the core of her musical life, she says, more important than performances.
‘I have enormous sympathy with people who find it difficult. I don’t think people talk about it enough.’ The secret, whether you do it for twenty minutes or five hours, is to work out beforehand what it is you are aiming to do, she says. Other tips: treat yourself - play the whole piece through, however many wrong notes. And mix hard with easy.",C2
"Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production, and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results.
All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Too Much Choice

Society is becoming ‘overchoiced’. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins.
Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for ‘simplexity’ - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep track of.

McAndrews Hotel

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition, instigated by my grandmother, and by now it has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests’ names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days.",C2
"POETRY RECITALS

At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it, and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. It is fairly safe to say that, at the present time, there is an especially bewildering complexity of poetic tendencies, of kinds of poetry being written, of warring factions, of ways of presenting, criticising and teaching poetry, and of conflicting beliefs about the role of the poet in society. 
Very broadly speaking, the present debate in contemporary poetry concerns the reciprocal mistrust and disapproval shown by the seriously committed 'literary' writers, whose poems are intended to be printed and read on the page, and the ‘popular’, performing poets who, while they will probably publish their verses in magazines and collections, are happier declaiming them to an audience. Of course, this division is far from absolute.
The practice of promoting public poetry readings has been steadily increasing over the past twenty years or so, in many different forms. Small literary societies in provincial towns conduct them in village halls or the sitting rooms of their members; schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to audiences of students; arts festivals often advertise poetry readings by well-known authors on their programmes. The consequences of all these events, and of poets being more or less obliged to become public performers, are manifold and of uncertain benefit to them as mists.
For the ‘pop’ poets, whose work has been composed expressly for the purpose of recital to live audiences, the issue is plain. They can only profit from public performance. Their verses are often very simple in both form and content, and can be assimilated at a single hearing; it is on the printed page that the deficiencies of thought, technique and imagination become clear. Poets who are dedicated to their craft, and are doing their best to continue and develop what is finest in the traditions of poetry - which involves compressing the maximum amount of passion, thought, wit and vision into the smallest possible space and achieving rhythmic effects of great variety and subtlety — are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience which is probably encountering their work for the first time. The danger here is, not that they will be tempted to emulate the content and style of the entertainers, but that they might, in the effort to achieve instant communication, read only their most readily accessible work which is quite likely to be their slightest and least characteristic. 
Attendance at poetry reading cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page, though it can be an enjoyable and instructive adjunct. To hear good poets read their work aloud, even if they are not accomplished public speakers, is a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken. The principal justification for popular recitals of poetry, where the readings are sometimes interspersed with musical items (jazz and poetry used to be a very popular mixture), is that audiences will come to associate poetry with pleasure and not feel that it is an art available only to an initiated minority.

"Photography

Over the past one and a half centuries, photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the medium has expanded its capabilities in the recording of time and space, thus allowing human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment or to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. It has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. Indeed, the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
Nonetheless, the recording of events by means of the visual image has a much longer history. The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. And although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of the early cave paintings - whether they record the ‘actual’ events of hunting, whether they functioned as sympathetic magic to encourage the increase of animals for hunting, whether they had a role as religious icons, or if they were made simply to enliven and brighten domestic activities - pictorial images seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it.
Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society. The popular notion that ‘seeing is believing’ had always afforded special status to the visual image. So when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense.
In the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of photography appeared to offer the promise of ‘automatically’ providing a truthful visual record. It was seen not only as the culmination of Western visual representation but, quite simply, the camera, functioning in much the same way as the human eye, was regarded as a machine which could provide a fixed image. And this image was considered to be a very close approximation to that which we actually see. The chemical fixing of the image enabled the capture of what might be considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, the photographic image was held to be an achievement of sophisticated culture and produced the type of image that artists had struggled throughout the centuries to acquire the manual, visual and conceptual skills to create.
It may seem a further irony that, because of the cameras perceived realism in its ability to replicate visual perception, it was assumed that all peoples would ‘naturally’ be able to understand photographs. This gave rise to the question of whether photography constituted a ‘universal language’. For example, in 1933 this view had been expressed in a series of radio broadcasts by photographer August Sander: ‘Even the most isolated Bushman could understand a photograph of the heavens — whether it showed the sun and moon or the constellations.’ However, in the face of the rapid increase in global communications which characterised the latter part of the twentieth century, we do at least need to ask to what extent the photographic image can penetrate through cultural differences in understanding. Or is photography as bound by cultural conventions as any other form of communication, such as language?
Is it possible that our familiarity with the photographic image has bred our current contempt for the intricacies and subtle methods that characterise the medium’s ability to transmit its vivid impressions of ‘reality’? Photography is regarded quite naturally as offering such convincing forms of pictorial evidence that this process of communication often seems to render the medium totally transparent, blurring the distinction between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations. It is the most natural thing in the world for someone to open their wallet and produce a photograph saying ‘this is my grandson’.
Ever since its invention in 1839, the technology of photography and the attitudes towards the medium by its practitioners have changed radically. This may partly be attributed to photography gradually moving into what might be termed ‘mythic time’ - its initial role as a nineteenth-century record-keeper has now moved beyond the human scale and photographic images, once immediate and close to photographer and subject alike, have now passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document, one which often reveals as much (if not more) about the individuals and society which produced the image as it does about its subject.
I hope to show that the camera is not merely a mute, passive chronicler of events, and that photography does not just passively reflect culture, but can provide the vision and impetus that promote social and political change and development. For example, it is difficult to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century without recognising the central role of the development of perspective in bringing about new visual means of representation. Similarly, photography has made a major contribution to the bringing about of the media culture that characterises our own era, while at the same time it has assumed the ironic role of bringing the harsh realities of the world to the coffee-table.",C2
"There are some activities that just will not be rushed. They take the time they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter.
The mind, too, works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can he speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot he rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line. 'Think fast; we need the results’ may sometimes be as absurd a notion, or at least as counterproductive, as the attempt to cram a night’s rest into half the time. We learn, think and know in a variety of ways, and these modes of the mind operate at different speeds, and are good for different mental jobs. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. ‘Look before you leap,’ says another. And both are true.
Roughly speaking, the mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations demand an unselfconscious, instantaneous reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London some years ago, my brain and my body immediately choreographed for me an intricate and effective set of movements that enabled me to keep my seat - and it was only after the action was all over that my conscious mind and my emotions started to catch up. Neither a concert pianist nor an Olympic fencer has time to figure out what to do next. There is a kind of 'intelligence' that works more rapidly than thinking. This mode of fast physical intelligence could be called our ‘wits’. (The five senses were originally known as 'the five wits'.)
Then there is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. A mechanic working out why an engine will not fire, a scientist trying to interpret an intriguing experimental result, a student wrestling with an assignment: all are employing a way of knowing that relies on reason and logic, on deliberate conscious thinking. We often call this kind of intelligence 'intellect’. Someone who is good at solving these sorts of problems we call 'bright' or 'clever'. But below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative. Perched on a seaside rock, lost in the sound and the motion of the surf, or hovering just on the brink of sleep or waking, we are in a different mental mode from the one we find ourselves in as we plan a meal or dictate a letter. This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury. We need the tortoise mind just as much as we need the hare brain.
Some kinds of everyday predicament are better, more effectively approached with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be penetrated with a relaxed, unquesting mental attitude. Recent scientific study shows convincingly that the more patient, less deliberate modes of mind are particularly suited to making sense of situations that are intricate, shadowy or ill defined. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is easily conceptualised. When we are trying to decide where to spend our holidays, it may well be perfectly obvious what the parameters are. But when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose - or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought - we need recourse to the tortoise mind. If the problem is how best to manage a difficult group of people at work, or whether to give up being a manager completely and retrain as a teacher, we may be better advised to sit and ponder than to search frantically for explanations and solutions. This type of intelligence is associated with what we call creativity, or even 'wisdom'.
Poets have always known the limitations of conscious, deliberate thinking, and have sought to cultivate these slower, mistier ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the realms of the mind that lie beyond and beneath the conscious intellect. It is only recently, however, that scientists have started to explore directly the slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The hybrid discipline of 'cognitive science' is revealing that the unconscious realms of the human mind will successfully accomplish a number of unusual, interesting and important tasks if they are given the time. They will learn patterns of a degree of subtlety which normal consciousness cannot even see, make sense out of situations that are too complex to analyse, and get to the bottom of certain difficult issues much more successfully than the questing intellect.

"Photography

When a photographer takes a photograph, he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, together with a set of social and cultural norms. And in the course of this book we shall see how these factors not only affect the style, content and expression of a photograph, but also how those images are perceived and responded to by the viewer. For example, we might consider that the casual reader of a newspaper will have an implicit understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the page. But rather than accepting the photograph at face value, we might question whether it accurately recorded the scene as it would have looked at the time. Or, in contrast, does it communicate the photographer’s point of view? Is it the precise instant recorded that is of particular importance, or should the photograph on the page be understood as a symbol to represent a state of affairs in the world?

More than a game

Sport for me has always been more than just a game. The most successful people in sport have total self-belief. You need tunnel vision if you want to succeed in sport. There’s only one route to being the best and you have to put everything else to one side. Sport is ruthless and no one else is going to do it for you. It’s sink or swim.
Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it can also teach you the benefits of working as one of a team. My sport allows and encourages you to excel individually, yet it is a team game and you have to balance these two aspects. It’s very much like life - you can succeed as an individual, but you must never forget there are others around you.
Sport has given me a great deal - and not just financially. It has opened doors for me and opened my eyes, and I’ve seen things around the world that others will never see. But you also have to give up a lot for those perks.

Tuning in

Some experiences etch themselves so sharply on our memory that they form islands of clarity in our recollection. For me, such a momentous occasion took place one night in California many years ago, when I lay awake listening to the rapturous strains of a mockingbird singing from an invisible location in one of the tall trees that were dotted around the suburban neighbourhood. I don’t suffer from insomnia - it was the exquisite artistry of the singer that kept me awake. As I followed his intricately woven melodies, I found myself drawn into an unexpected aesthetic environment. In order to follow the patterns that issued from the bird, I had to call on my experience of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird had me convinced that I was being treated to an ad lib performance of the most breathtaking improvisational acrobatics. I groaned and I cheered as one improbable musical variation followed another through the open window where I lay listening, until finally I fell asleep.",C2
"Observing Lions

In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case, their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild, we have acquired a less exalted view. 
When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt, rear cubs and among other things, scare off rivals with chorused roars. If the ultimate success of an animals behaviour is measured by its lifetime production of surviving offspring, then cooperation does not necessarily pay: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. Why, then, did not the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?
We confidently assumed that we would be able to resolve that issue in two to three years. But lions are supremely adept at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases, including krypton, argon and neon, we would add lion. Thus it has taken a variety of research measures to uncover clues about the cats behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear. 

Pop Music Review

The release of Bedrock’s third album was more than just a landmark in the career of a talented but hitherto precarious band. New Life launched a movement that effectively redesigned the specification of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Out went the earnest angst, plain-shirted drabness and overdriven guitars of a previous era; in came a lighter blend of melodious homegrown styles. A mix of social observation and strident anger mingled easily here with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were well to the fore, as were the voices that felt no need to disguise their origins.
The album showed Bedrock to be skilful magpie collectors and observers, and a cunningly versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they went larkily after traditional English preoccupations such as sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album’s real strength lay in the gentle melancholy depths it plumbed on tracks such as ‘So Low’, a gorgeous unfurling tune loosely hung around the theme of meteorology, and ‘To the Brink’, a ballad that allowed no smirking at the back. The beauty of New Life is its consistently sky-high quality - 16 tracks with absolutely no filler remains an unsurpassed record in the era of loiteringly long CDs.

Extract from an autobiography

As a child I was always fascinated by stories of ‘The Sibyl’, those mysteriously wise women who wielded such influence in the ancient world. To begin with, I only knew of the existence of one who appeared in a tale my mother had told me. An old woman of Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused and she burnt three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused, she again burnt three books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. 
I realised even then that there was a profound truth hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and in life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I used to ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson that I’ve never forgotten.
When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to look for something that I could bear to find out about, something that was relevant to my life. I’m a reluctant traveller - at the first opportunity I sent my editor a very long list of places I wasn’t prepared to go to. When it comes down to it, I’m only interested in ruins, because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

What becomes of your manuscript?

When you submit your manuscript it will most likely join a heap waiting for someone to sort and sift before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. The someone is usually either the editorial department junior (i.e. under 18) or an old hand who comes in a couple of mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of these has much influence, but they are basically on your side and out to discover something original - the junior to make his or her name and acquire an author of their own if they are lucky, the old hand to justify continuing freelance employment.
If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it on to a more senior editor and eventually it will surface at an acquisition meeting. The championing editor will not only have to justify accepting your novel on the grounds of intrinsic merit and potential sales, but also say whether you as an author seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Also the question is raised of how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. To this end, publishers often like to meet a potential author before clinching the offer.",C2
"Self-help books

Dione Reverend was a mere editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr John Gray. ‘I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,’ she says, chuckling, and she was right. The desperately understanding Dr Gray is now a multimillionaire and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr Gray's slim volume on how to bridge communication gaps between the sexes is the unofficial mascot of a huge and expanding self-help industry that may, as its insiders claim, answer some of American’s myriad yearnings for betterment. It also feeds off those yearnings, creates hundreds more and - not incidentally - props up the entire world of New York publishing.
As Britain is learning, the genre can fill entire polls with tomes os quackish and histrionic as their covers - but there are worse. For every self-help title published, thousands are rejected as too derivative or specialised. This is no small mercy. As a new breed of heavyweight editor-cum-ogent goes looking for the next lightweight blockbuster, prose style is the lost thing on anybody's mind. Marketability is everything. ‘How promotable is the author? What’s the ”hook’? Is it universal enough?' Ms Reverend rattles off the key questions, then admits: ‘If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.'

Autobiographies

There has to be a tacit understanding, a pact, between an autobiographer and reader that the truth is being told. Such at pact is, I would guess, rarely observed to the full. There are many reasons why the writer should lapse. There may be actions or thoughts which he feels it is simply too shameful to make public. There may be things he decides against putting down on paper because (as he rationalises) they are not important enough. There are also more complex and interesting reasons for surreptitiously breaking the pact. The autobiographer may decide that the ultimate goal of the work, the truth about himself, can be served by inventing stories that encapsulate the truth more neatly, more pointedly than strict adherence to the facts ever could. Or he may break the pact by deciding, from the beginning, never to adhere to it. He may call his book an autobiography simply in order to create a positive balance of credulity in the reader’s mind that will be extremely convenient for him in his storytelling, and which, in the case of his more naive readers, may not be exhausted even by the time the story ends, so that these readers will go away thinking they have read a true history, when they have read nothing but a fiction. All of which can be done in no particular spirit of cynicism.

Dashiell Hammett’s detective stories

Students of the detective story have explained the flourishing of this genre as an expression of the conflicts of late nineteenth and early twentieth century society. The detective story is essentially an allegory. The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society, its lawless impulses quelled so that society can again function smoothly. In Hammett’s peculiar version, society is returned to its former state, but that itself is shown to be corrupt and false.
The hunter and the hunted in Hammett’s tales are two aspects of the same personality. The private eye and his prey understand each other and are, in a strange way, comfortable with each other. The private eye has a foot in each camp. From the point of view of the criminal he is a bit too straight, and from that of the law a bit too seedy. He is at once a crook and a competitor. The mission of the private eye is sometimes tempered by his sense of complicity, and sometimes his punitive zeal is intensified by his anxiety about this ambiguity.

SCIENCE WRITING

Today’s greatest scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss that art and hear his advice, I met him in an unfamiliar milieu: at the Grand Hotel (where he was staying while promoting his new book). Neither of us, it has to be said, felt much at home. As for writing a piece set in surroundings of such lifeless self-aggrandisement, Gould said: 'I couldn't do it: Trollope might but he knew the culture. And knowing the culture is central to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is a civilisation of its own. As a result, only scientists can make a good job of presenting it. If you don’t live in the community and don’t understand its rules, you are crippled from the start.'
One of Gould’s axioms is: never write down to the reader. 'Make no concessions,' he says. 'You can simplify the language but must never adulterate it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers notice that they are being patronised, your piece is dead.'",C2
"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly, by hand. It is, in other words, not only an agricultural metaphor, it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production, if the conditions are right, of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction. The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate.
Since television as a technology is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments. Two little-known, distinct alternatives deserve mentioning since they highlight what television might have been - in a different social context.
Experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone were followed up, so to speak, by radio amateurs in Britain in the early 1930s. Various popular science journals, such as Radio News, had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers and, throughout the 1930s, experimenting amateurs were active in many parts of the country. But Big Business, represented by the British Radio Manufacturers Association, in 1938 agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out. And so there passed, at least in Britain, the historical 'moment' for a counter-cultural development of television as a widely diffused, grass-roots, egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting in some form was, however, tied not only to strong economic interests, but also to the deep structures of modern societies. In spite of the activities of TV amateurs, television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s, and as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry. In fact, television was throughout the 19030s predominantly watched in public settings also outside of the USA. For example, in Britain, public viewing of television was the way in which most early audiences actually experienced the medium and this was even more the case in Germany. While the vision of grass-roots or amateur, two-way television was quite obviously doomed to a very marginal position at the very best, television systems largely based on collective public reception were in fact operating in several countries in the 1930s and may, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen as having presented more of a threat to the domestication of the medium. But it was a threat that was not to materialise.
Manufacturers saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets as soon as the price could be reduced, and given the division and relation between the public and private domains fundamental to modernity, centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states. And all of this is now also happening on a global scale.
There is a clear relationship between the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernisation meant increasing centralisation and concentration of capital and political power, the break-up of traditional communities produced new ways of life. Mobility was both social and geographical, and both forms implied that individuals and households were, both literally and metaphorically, 'on the move' in ways that left them relatively isolated compared to people in much more stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting was both an answer to the need felt by central government to reach all citizens with important information efficiently, and a highly useful instrument in the production of the harmonising, stabilising 'imagined community’ of the nation-state.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the World Wars, the interest in broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources necessary for conscious, informed and autonomous participation in political, social and cultural life played a very important role in many countries. Of course television is changing, and there is the risk that the very term broadcasting becomes outmoded or at least inadequate. In which case, this metaphor will be seen only as referring to a particular organisation of audio-visual technology during a certain centralised phase of social modernisation. ",C2
"We are Talking Big Boots here. Really BIGTIME Boots.
I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn’t working. I squinted info the morning sun looking out at the Arizona mountains and I had to admit, I was not at home on the range,
Flying in from Denver just after dawn, I had the feeling that I just might pass far an ol' cowhand coming in from the sky. The feeling didn’t last past the first real cowboy in the luggage hall of Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweat-stained I-shirt, needed a shave, and was hoisting a dirty canvas bag off the conveyer belt when he caught sight of my brand new cowboy boots. He slowly raised one eyebrow and moved off out of the door without looking back.
There ought to be, somewhere, hanging in a closet, a suit of clothes an ex-racing driver can put on without feeling like he is from another planet. Something he could wear so that wherever he goes he doesn’t get the feeling that everybody is talking another language and doing whatever they do at half speed. I liked, no, not liked... I flatout loved being a racing driver, driving racing cars. I am addicted to it and it is all I know how to do. But I don’t do it any more. I couldn’t if I wanted to. Question is, I thought, looking into the mean, rust-coloured rock of the mountains in the distance, what do I do now?
A racing driver should have one or two fall-back identities lined up for when he climbs out of his car. I thought I did, but when I reached for them they just disappeared. How about: an ex-racing driver adds colour to the commentary direct from the trackside? 'We got fifteen guys, all of them former Indy and Formula One drivers, fifteen guys in front of you, Forrest, standing in line to be colour commentators. We’ll call you.'
Well then, how about: an ex-racing driver coins a partnership to sell classic cars? That lasted nearly all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers und meetings with bankers. But it was the year nobody was buying old Ferraris and Honda was 'reviewing' its dealer list. So in the end I gracefully withdrew before there was nothing to withdraw from. Being an 'ex' anything is depressing work. I mean you tell me, how badly do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in ‘almost'. And even if I had been world champion you could probably just about stand to listen to the story for five minutes before your ears turned to cement. Last year's champion was last year.
Not that I want sympathy. Which is just as well, since I don’t get any. Well, why should I? I had a good run, made money and hung on to enough. But oh, man, I miss the heat of slipping into that graceful, elegant, shrink-wrapped super-tech machine with seven hundred horsepower behind my neck. Zero to a hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4,9 seconds. And yes, I miss coming within an eyelash of killing myself every race or so. I miss the bright and gorgeous people and the reporters who acted as if what I said mattered. Being famous, even in a minor way, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians bragged to their friends that they knew me. Little boys slid under fences to get my autograph. And now that I don’t drive a racing car... Only last week the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and I have time in the afternoon. And let me just check, but I think tomorrow is free, so much empty time.
I looked up into the soft blue morning sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little brown birds in a saguaro cactus just in front of me were giving me advice, something like 'get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out’. It had never occurred to me that the desert had songbirds. It did occur to me that a bogus cowboy in designer boots had a lot to learn.",C2
"THE WELL

I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole, one could see the stars, if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched, eyes wide, fist to mouth, as I winched up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I had not thought to allow for the bucket’s much increased weight, your lack of strength or inclination to just stand back and let what would happen, happen. You held the handle, taking some of the strain as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well’s stone surround. Freed of the wall’s support, I plunged immediately. You gave a little shriek and made one attempt to brake the handle, then you let it go. I fell into the well. I cracked my head.
It did not occur to me then that I had succeeded, in a sense, in my plan. What I saw were lights, strange, inchoate and bizarre. It was only later that I connected the visual symptoms of that fall and impact with the stylised stars and planets I was used to seeing drawn in a cartoon panel whenever a comic character suffered a similar whack.
At the time I was at first just dazed, then frightened, then relieved, then finally both angry at you for letting me fall and afraid of what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was all right. I opened my mouth to shout, and then you called again, a note of rising panic in your voice, and with those words stopped mine in my throat. I lay still, eyelids cracked enough to watch you through the foliage of lashes. You disappeared, calling out for help. I waited a moment, then quickly hauled and pushed my way to the top, then pulled myself over the edge and landed on the courtyard cobbles.
I could hear raised, alarmed voices coming from the castle’s main door. I ran the opposite way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows there.
Mother and Father both appeared along with you and old Arthur; Mother shrieked, flapping her hands. Father shouted and told Arthur to haul on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked, watching. I was bowed in the shadows. A fire of fierce elation filled me. Then I saw the line of drops I’d left, from the well to where I now stood. I looked in horror at the spots, dark coins of dirty well water fallen from my soaking clothes on to the dry, grey cobbles. At my feet, in the darkness, the water had formed a little pool.
I looked back into the courtyard, to where Father was now shining a flashlight down into the well and peering into the gloom. The drops I had left shone in the sunlight. I could not believe that nobody had seen them. Mother was screaming hysterically now, a sharp, jarring noise that I had never heard before. It shook my soul, suffused my conscience. What was I to do? I had had my revenge on you, but where did I go from here?
This had quickly become more serious than I’d anticipated, escalating with dizzying rapidity from a great prank born of a brilliant brainwave to something that would not be put to rest without some serious, painful and lasting punishment being inflicted on somebody, almost certainly myself. I cursed myself for not thinking this through. From crafty plan, to downfall, to wheeze, to calamity; all in a few minutes.
The plan came to me like a lifebelt to a drowning man. I gathered all my courage and left my hiding place, coming staggering out and blinking. I cried out faintly, one hand to my brow, then yelled out a little louder when my first cry went unheeded. I stumbled on a little further, then collapsed dramatically on the cobbles.
Sitting up, comforted, my head in my weeping mother’s bosom, I went ‘Phew’ and said ‘Oh dear' and smiled bravely and claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and crawled and swum along it until I got out, climbed up the bridge and tottered, exhausted, through the passageway.
To this day I think I was almost getting away with it until Father appeared squatting in front of me. He had me repeat my story. I did so, hesitating. His eyes narrowed.
Thinking I was plugging a gap, in fact only adding another log to my pyre, I said that the secret passage had fallen in after me; there wouldn't be any point in, say, sending somebody down to look for it. In fact the whole well was dangerous. I’d barely escaped with my life. I looked into my father’s eyes and it was like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars at the end.
It was as though he was seeing me for the first time, and as though I was looking down a secret passage through time, to an adult perspective, to the way the world and cocky, lying children’s stories would look to me when I was his age.
My words died in my throat. ‘Don’t be ridiculous, boy,' he said, investing more contempt in those few words than I’d have thought a whole language capable of conveying. He rose smoothly to his feet and walked away.
Arthur looked down at me, his expression regretful and troubled, shaking his head or looking like he wanted to, not because I had had a terrifying adventure and then been unjustly disbelieved by my own father, but because he too could see through my forlorn and hapless lie, and worried for the soul, the character, the future moral standing of any child so shameless - and so incompetent - in its too easily resorted-to lying.
In that pity was a rebuke as severe and wounding as that my father had administered, and in as much that it confirmed that this was the mature judgement of my actions and my father’s, not some aberration I might be able to discount or ignore, it affected me even more profoundly.",C2
"Maps

The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. In early times distance wha often expressed in units of time, for example ‘so many hours’ march’ or ‘a day’s journey by river’, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than they did about actual distance. The other element is direction, but for the ordinary traveller, whose main concern was ‘Where do I go from here?’ and ‘How far away is it?’, the accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Partly for this reason, written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Even today, certain types of maps, for example those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Similarly, conspicuous landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs, realistic or conventional, and varied in size to indicate their importance. Clearly the conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map, and also from place to place, so that in studying early maps the first essential is to understand the particular convention employed.
The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which these elements of distance and direction are determined and in the comprehensiveness of the map content. In this development, cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. For example, instead of determining direction by observing the position of a shadow at midday, or of a constellation in the night sky, or even of a steady wind, use was made of terrestrial magnetism through the magnetic compass, and instruments were evolved which enabled horizontal angles to be calculated with great accuracy. 
The application of astronomical concepts, and the extension of the knowledge of the world through 
exploration, encouraged attempts to map the known world. Then astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is flattened slightly at the poles, which introduced further refinements into the mapping of large areas. Meanwhile, the demands being made of the map maker were shifting significantly. The traveller or the merchant ceased to be the sole user of maps. The soldier, especially after the introduction of artillery, and the problems of range, field of fire, and dead ground which it raised, demanded an accurate representation of the surface features, in place of the earlier conventional or pictorial delineation, and a solution in any degree satisfactory was not reached until the contour was invented.
Then there was the archaeologist, the historian and, much later, the modern geographer, each with their own special requirements. In order to address these, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of ‘distributions’, from geological strata and climatic regimes to land use. It is the present widespread recognition of the value of the map in the co-ordination and interpretation of phenomena in many sciences that has led to what may truly be called a modern renaissance o cartography.
It would be misleading of me to represent the stages summarily sketched above as being either continuous or consecutive. There have been periods of retrogression or stagnation, broken by others of rapid development, during which outmoded ideas have held their place beside the new. Again, cartographers have constantly realised the theoretical basis for progress, but have had to wait for technical improvement in their instruments before they could apply their new ideas. Since the easiest way to make a map is to copy an old one, and considerable capital has often been locked up in printing places or stock map publishers have often been resistant to new ideas. Consequently, maps must never be accepted uncritically as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique. 
Clearly, the maps, many thousands in number, which have come down to us today, are the results of much human work and thought. They constitute therefore an invaluable record for the students of man’s past. It is above all this aspect that makes the study of historical cartography so fascinating and so instructive.",C2
"The Heat is On

We’ve all heard of global warming, but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives?

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about, but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. And since the atmosphere is intimately linked every aspect of the planet on which we live, any changes to climate will have significant knock-on effects for plants and animals, as well as water and soils.
We humans have learned to use such natural resources to our advantage, enabling us to produce food, build great cities and support six billion members of the human race. Any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously. The problem we have is knowing just how the world will change, and what is causing these changes.
There is no doubt, for example, that over the last 100 years or so, human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases — which are closely related to global temperature. It seems likely that these increased concentrations, which are set to continue building up in the near future, are already affecting global climate, but our poor knowledge and understanding of the global heat balance make the current and future situations uncertain. What we do know is that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have fluctuated in close harmony with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years.
This would indicate that the two are almost certainly related. Evidence gleaned from a range of sources suggests that our planet has warmed at the surface by about 6C over the past century. Most scientists think that this trend is unlikely to be natural in origin and is, in part, a result of human pollution of the atmosphere.
A lot of research has gone into predicting the conditions that will result from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs known as general circulation models, or GCMs. They run on powerful computers, use fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to analyse the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation and other climatic factors to predict climatic condition for the past, present or future.
Unfortunately, they are simplifications of the real would and have numerous deficiencies. Their results are only approximate and they are also slow to run and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system, although we do realise its complexity.
Despite these research difficulties, most people agree on perhaps the most important aspect of climatic change from the viewpoint of contemporary human societies: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. In this case, the approximate predictions produced by GCMs are being used to gain some insight into the nature and conditions of the world that we will inhabit over the next few generations.
Currently, they suggest that the average annual global surface temperature will increase by between 1C and 3.5C by the year 2100; that the average sea level around the world will rise by 15-95 cm; and that changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, to become more frequent in some places.
These forecasts should leave us in little doubt about the potential impact of climatic change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate have the potential to affect the geographical locations of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands, the mix of species they contain and their ability to provide the various benefits on which societies depend for their continued existence. Thus, the whole range of resources on which we rely is sensitive to changes in climate. This includes food production, water resources and human settlements. The effects, some of which are potentially irreversible, are likely to be unfavourable in many areas.
But this would not be true for all. In fact, some climate change impacts will probably be beneficial. Scientists in some countries have already identified useful environmental trends that are closely linked to the warming that has occurred to date. In Australia, for example, research has shown that the average yield of wheat has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, and climate trends have played a significant part in this greater food production.
The most important climatic factor observed in this case was the rise, in recent decades, of the minimum temperature. Among other things, the warmer temperatures have meant fewer frosts, and this has caused less damage to harvests. 
However, many of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. Relatively small changes in climate can influence the availability of water, either due to long-term dying of the climate or by increasing the frequency of droughts. Associated problems are likely to arise first in arid and semi-arid regions and more humid areas where demand or pollution have already created shortages.
The Mediterranean Basin is one example of this and in recent decades decreasing trends in precipitation totals have already been identified in western-central parts of the basin as well as marked changes in seasonality. A clear tendency for rainfall to be concentrated into a shorter period of the year has been noted in the Alentejo region of southern Portugal, with the proportion of annual rainfall falling in autumn and winter, increasing at the expense of spring totals.
A further undesirable effect is likely to be changes to glacial processes. This will impact on glacier ice, ground ice and sea ice, which in turn will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats and human structures and facilities. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that the Arctic’s ice cover will melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.
But probably the most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the twenty-first or ‘greenhouse’ century will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean — warmer water occupies a greater volume than cold water — and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world’s population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe.
Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results, with London, New York and Tokyo being just a few of the candidates for significant disruption. Huge numbers of people stand to lose their homes and livelihoods and this could produce many millions of environmental refugees.
Arguably the most severe consequences would be experienced by several small, low-lying island states, since entire countries could cease to exist if worst-case scenarios are realised. The consequences would be devastating, not only for the people and culture of these islands, but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those who had been displaced.",C2
"Work

Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.

Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood, and even among individuals who have won eminence, there is often bitterness behind the fame. Loving your work, until recently, was enough to make you a member of an envied minority. But now you have to ask yourself what your job is doing to you as a person, to your mind, character and relationships.
This question is crucial. For however brilliant your skills, if they make you a bore, unable to converse with those outside your speciality, if you are so busy with detail that you have no time to acquire wisdom or exercise your imagination or humour, then no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this, I am trying to discover how work could have the fulfilment of these aspirations as its first priority - instead of treating us as clay to be moulded to suit industrial purposes - and how it could be reconceived to suit us all, both women and men. It would have to be not just a way of creating wealth, but a worthwhile style of life, a path to a fuller existence, to the discovery of unsuspected talents and to a wider variety of human contacts.
However, this remodelling would not mean abolishing unemployment. This is too simple a goal, because the more people are educated, the more they demand jobs that are life-enhancing, interesting and useful. A lifetime of work has to be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its centre.
Even the middle-class professions, however, no longer have the liberating appeal they once had. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients and complain about the failure of clinical medicine. Accountants, despite unprecedented influence, are troubled by doubts about their profession's ethics. Most architects never get the chance to exercise their imaginations freely. Administrators are paralysed by their own bureaucracy. The middle managers, who once gloried in their status, are, as a European study reveals, losing their conviction.
Meanwhile, the business corporations and public institutions in which these people work are slimming. The panaceas of decentralised decision-making, increasing skills and performance-related rewards have not succeeded in winning commitment from employees. In Britain, only 8 per cent of employees ‘are strongly of the view that their values and those of their organisations are very similar’.
I have embarked on an investigation of a wide range of occupations, one by one, to see how each shapes and sometimes destroys those in it. I have studied how the notion of what humans are capable of has been expanded in different civilisations, and how courage can be manufactured. I have applied my method to the major preoccupations of our time - happiness, love, friendship and respect.
Having looked at those areas, I am now focusing on the search for more satisfying ways of earning a living. There is no shortage of experts devoting themselves to prolonging the life and increasing the income of corporations and institutions. But auditing our finances is not enough: we need to make an audit of ourselves as human beings too, and discover with what sort of people we want to spend our lives.
How many of us can say that we are fully alive at work? How many of us are really part-time slaves - theoretically having the right to escape from our drudgery, but in reality virtual prisoners of our qualifications and careers, used as instruments by others, working not so that we might become better people, but because we can see no other option?
Take hotel workers as an example, since 10 per cent of the working population is now in the ‘hospitality industry'. The amount of unused potential is unbelievable. Many highly intelligent and lively people put up with low prestige, low salaries and long hours.
This is because there has been no serious rethinking of what a hotel is since the days of the Ritz, with its nineteenth-century idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place where travellers sleep, but a United Nations in miniature. People from all over the world meet at hotels, though they usually pass each other in silence.
A large proportion of hotel staff are foreigners too, keen to learn a new language and discover a new civilisation, but they have the most superficial relations with their guests. Hotels could be cultural centres, active intermediaries between the guest and the city, genuine hosts bringing together people who have not met. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the many students they employ, instead of giving them only menial tasks.
If they paid closer attention to their staff’s deepest ambitions, they would realise that there were many other services that hotels could provide. But they are restrained by the accountants, who say that firms, in order to maximise their profits, should concentrate on one core activity.
The time has come to rethink what this term denotes - from a human, not just a financial angle - and to move on from traditional categorisations. For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people are not content with relations based on obedience, and regard work as an assertion of independence or temperament, they must be given a chance to design their own jobs, and choose their own colleagues, even their customers, within the limits of practicality and profitability.
This means that they have to know how to converse across the boundaries of professional jargon, with minds that may at first seem quite alien. Everybody is clear about the importance of communication, but it is a very different thing from conversation, and traditional conversation is very different from the new kind of conversation which people feel the lack of today.
This is a more intimate encounter, which creates a bond of respect between the participants, and is valued as a way of getting inside another person’s skin, with the likelihood that one will be changed by the experience. It is more than a relaxation, because it is the most effective means of establishing equality. Every time you have a conversation which achieves that, the world is changed by a minute amount.",C2
"England’s breakfast revolution 

The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. Admittedly, there are scattered references to travellers having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys, and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs or nobles. 
However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast, as individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours. Often this involved starting work extremely early. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone. ",C2
"In those days the council houses stretched all over the western side of the city: row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer the chemicals from the May and Baker factory two miles away came and hung round the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur, and the most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody’s front path.
Most of this early life I’ve forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting, or perhaps balancing, at any rate precariously, on some vantage point near an upstairs window, and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother, ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don’t think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
That my mother should intrude into these early memories is no surprise. I remember her as a small, precise and nearly always angry woman, the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn’t do anything to appease. Even as a child, though, accompanying her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer excursions into the city, I’m sure that I had some notion of the oddity of her personality.
She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which occasionally broke out in furious spring-cleanings or handwashings and instructions to ‘behave proper’.
As a moral code this was completely beyond my comprehension: even now I’m not sure that I understand it. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours’ gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked; it meant - oh, a hundred proscriptions and prohibitions.
In time other figures emerged onto these stern early scenes. For all her solitariness, my mother wasn't without her cronies. There was Mrs Buddery, who was fixated on the Royal Family, Mrs Winall, who said exactly nothing, except for grunts supporting the main speaker, and Mrs Laband - livelier than the others, and of whom they vaguely disapproved.
It was only later that I comprehended what poor company this trio was, they formed a depressed and depressing sisterhood, a little dribble of inconsequent talk about bad legs, the cold weather and the perils of ingrate children, a category in which I nearly always felt myself included.
Looking back, it was as if a giant paperweight, composed of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her cronies, the obligation to ‘behave proper’, lay across my shoulders, and that it was my duty immediately to grow up and start the work of prising it free.
This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet (I can remember awful aimless days, when I must have been about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat frostily in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.
The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat - these were extraordinary contraptions in cast-iron with improvised safety-straps. As far as I recall, my mother consigned me to the care of other children in the street for this journey.
If I remember anything about these early years it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught occasional glimpses of the world that existed outside West Earlham: a vague old man who lived next door to Mrs Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete, once, held at a house far away in Christchurch Road, where a motherly woman doled out lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity - a kind of junior charity, I think - only for my mother, to whom subsequent application was made, to dismiss the scheme on the grounds that its organisers were ‘only after your money’.
Mercenary motives were a familiar theme of my mother’s conversation, and politicians my mother held in the deepest contempt of all. If she thought of the House of Commons - and I am not sure if her mind was capable of such an unprecedented leap of the imagination - it was as a kind of opulent post office where plutocrats ripped open letters stuffed with five pound notes sent in by a credulous public.
No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I ignore her virtues and magnify her frailties. But there was precious little milk of human kindness in my mother, 
it had all been sucked out of her, sucked out and thrown away.
To do my mother justice she wasn’t unconscious of her role as the guardian of my education. On Sundays occasionally, she would take me - in my ‘good clothes' - on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Here, hand-in-hand, suspicious, but mindful of the free admission, we would parade through roomfuls of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists.
My mother wasn’t, it must be known, altogether averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification. I can remember her stopping once in front of a fine study of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to remark, ‘Well, I wouldn’t like to meet him on a dark night!’ I recall this as a solitary instance of my mother attempting to make a joke.",C2
"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON

American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America, however, has only just discovered him - although the Wall Street Journal's description of Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose beats went all but unnoticed for most of the 20th century' is taking things too far. But now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are in production and are expected to spring off the shells as fast as they are stacked; the American Museum of Natural History is mounting a grand exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is preparing a film based on Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as icon and exemplar. His sell-appointed apostles recount the details of his deeds with awe; they extract lessons in leadership and communications as parables for spin doctors, and insiders refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined, resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, took Shackleton for a role model years ago. His firm specialises in ‘communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises’. Such as? Such as ‘this firm's plant blew up’ or 'half the workforce has to go'. While not forgetting that Shackleton served time in public relations for a Glasgow steel works, it may be a trifle difficult to spot instantly the relevance of eking out the last bit of albatross in sub-zero temperatures to putting a spin on a derivatives trading disaster for the Internet.
‘Even if a company manages its crises beautifully, it can still do a lot of harm by communicating sadly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. he was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose — such as their lives. In some ways the most fascinating decision Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That trip explained his credibility for the next one: the lives of his men were paramount.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their objective, with unforeseen delays draining their supplies and limited time to get back to their ship, Shackleton made the courageous and difficult decision to turn hack.
In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Whereas now the tendency is for managers to duck and squirm, Shackleton was prepared to stand up and accept responsibility. His 1914 expedition was the one that became the stuff of legend. His ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in the pack ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it finally went down, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries the then kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men continually informed and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. ‘He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling thry’re being criticised.'
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. ‘One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating, especially in America, a culture that is fanatically opposed to letting time sort things out,’ says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you’ll get your money back. To “fix it” and sell up would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product's a stinker, don't keep selling it.’
Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expeditions: ‘He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavour is increasing. Shackleton exposes the fact that there is nothing heroic going on now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the genuine embodiment of the ideals that we are so wistful for nowadays.'

"Goat Racing

I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans, hordes of people, food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse, I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. An area had been cordoned off to make a course for competitors. Not quite on a par with established racecourses, but on the similar assumption that spectators were to line either side of a stretch of ground along which the participants would travel. An attempt was being made to keep a handful of select goats in order. No mean feat when dealing with an animal fabled to eat almost anything it can get hold of.

Canoe Trip

As the day drew to a close, I started to think about the night ahead, and I shuddered with fear. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, and with the aid of our torch we could just make out the line of the cliffs; the torch batteries were failing, so we put in new ones, but they didn't work. Obviously we weren’t going to be able to spot a camping place. A couple of miles later, Lesley called out that she had seen a distant flickering light and our hopes soared: the light turned out to be moonlight glinting on waves, soon we could hear the roaring noise of fast-rushing water, though we couldn’t see what was happening. Time stood still, and we moved on.

How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions

I am not a natural at making presentations, yet in my role as managing director I am increasingly required to present infernally to my colleagues, not to mention externally to the major shareholders. How can I improve my presentational techniques and my confidence?
You are not the only one. Making a presentation involves completely different skills from those you need to run a company, yet more and more senior executives are expected to be accomplished at it.
If you are trying to convince your audience of something, you have to be convinced yourself. Demonstrate your conviction in the passion and enthusiasm you bring to the presentation. That means you must do your homework. Test your proposition carefully in advance. Ask colleagues to identify the ‘hard questions’ your audience might put to you. You also need to build a positive climate from the outset. Begin with an area of common ground that people can identify with and build gradually towards the conclusion you want to reach.",C2
"Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds.
But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports

There's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird, a bird of portent, augury and divination. Is it spelling out some sort of message from a world at the very edges of my imagination? Or is it just a poor bird stuck in a greenhouse?
Depending on your point of view, both could be true. Wrens have been flitting through the undergrowth of British culture ever since it began. In medieval times, a complicated system of observing the directions in which wrens flew determined the sort of luck the observer would experience. In modern times, the image of the wren remains in pictures and ceramics in many British households. Even though the early beliefs may have been watered down or even forgotten, the wren still has a perch in our consciousness and a nest in our affections. A wood without wrens is a sad, impoverished place.
This is almost certainly because there is a rich vein of folklore running through our relationships with many birds which reaches back to a time when people read the world around them differently. Where people are, necessarily, hitched more directly to natural processes for their very survival, they develop an ecological and cultural language through which the significance of other creatures is communicated. This significance is, of course, prone to cultural shifts that cause major image changes for the creatures involved. A good example of this is the red kite. During the early sixteenth century, foreign visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take bread from the hands of children. These birds were protected and valued urban scavengers. But it was not long before they began to be seen as vermin, and as a result were soon wiped out in most areas apart from Wales. Gradually red kites began to assume a romantic personality linked to this Celtic stronghold and they have now become totemic birds of British conservation, protected again and reintroduced with a view to helping them regain their original distribution.
Our relationship with other creatures is more than cultural and goes way back to the evolution of human nature. Though the first human birdwatchers may have been acutely observant of bird behaviour because it announced approaching predators, bad weather and the availability of food, and also offered a supernatural link to the world of their dreams, there is more to it. When we ask why birds are so important to us, we are also asking what it is to be us. Flight, song, freedom - our fascination, envy and emulation of the avian world is surely a measure of our own identity against that of the wildness of nature. Some might dismiss these feelings as vestigial attachments, useful to us in an earlier phase of our evolution, irrelevant now. But, like the appendix and wisdom teeth, they're still very much part of us and losing them is traumatic.
That is probably why, in recent years, birds have become the barometers of environmental change, indicators of ecological quality: the warning bells of environmentalism. Conservationists in Britain cite the endangering of 30 species, a figure that is depressing not only because it spells out the loss of feathered curiosities, but because it is a massive cultural loss too.These birds carry a huge amount of cultural baggage. For example, the skylark, turtle dove and lapwing signify spiritual love, romantic love and magic. Anyone who has read Shelley’s poems, Shakespeare’s sonnets and Robert Graves’s The White Goddess will feel more than a tug of remorse at the loss of these once commonplace birds.
Yet while the loss of these birds is lamented, the loss of others which don't figure in either literature or folklore is virtually ignored. Folklore is so important. The stories, legends and rhymes which persist through time, with their obscure origins, constant revisions and reinventions, somehow have a greater living bond with their subjects than cold, scientific terms a bond that is strengthened by the everyday language in which they are understood and communicated. This gives them a power to summon up feelings and attitudes from a consciousness buried under all the stuff of modern life.
Whether we watch wildlife films on TV or birdtables in the backyard, what were doing and the excitement we get from what we see cannot adequately be captured by scientific reason. Birds are engaging in ways we still find hard to fathom, let alone articulate, and so the stories we tell about them seem like ways of interpreting what birds are telling us.
The wren in the greenhouse weaves an intricate knot, tying an imaginary thread between the here and now and a deep, distant history, holding the free end in its song and escaping into the future - a riddle that keeps me guessing.

"Online Literary Criticism For All

Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?

From the outset, the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice, however, a certain amount of technical know-how was required, at least in the early years.
However, there was at least one field, previously restricted to the few, that was genuinely opened up to the masses. By visiting the pages of Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, anyone was able to try their hand at literary criticism.
Amazon’s egalitarian approach to book reviews — namely, that anyone could say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars - looked, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon’s site, and whenever a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically.
This meant that Amazon got to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers of a book could see what other readers thought of it, for better or worse, rather than reading just the blurb from the publisher and the views of professional critics.
Other online bookstores which also operated as large bricks-and-mortar bookshop chains provided similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted by far the greatest number of reviews and, accordingly, encountered the most funny business.
For this critical free-for-all lent itself to subversion of various subtle and not-so-subtle kinds. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day - Amazon would not say exactly how many - so it was impractical to vet them all. Instead, a team of editors scoured the site, checking that reviews conformed to the company's guidelines.
Single-word reviews, for instance, or personal attacks on the author, were not allowed. Nor were reviews that contained obscenities, gave away the ending, or referred to other reviews. Ultimately, however, the reviewers were anonymous (they were not required to give their real names) and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon checkers noticed them. So there was plenty of scope for mischief.
For example, there was nothing to stop writers giving their own books glowing reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was so mortified by the bad reviews that readers gave his first novel (‘infantile trash’, ‘puerile pap') that he submitted several anonymous ones of his own (‘hilarious’, ‘fabulous’) to redress the balance. His ruse succeeded until he wrote an article detailing his deception. The fake reviews were promptly removed. 
Authors were, in fact, provided with their own way to hold forth: by clicking on a link marked ‘I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.’ Most authors who used this feature posted jolly messages expressing their desire that browsers would buy, and enjoy, the book in question. A few even gave their email addresses, thus inviting readers to communicate directly. Yet authors who posted messages knew that while Amazon did vet them, it did not check that they really came from the author.
An exception to this was made in the case of big names. A little-known writer submitted an authors comment, purporting to be from John Updike, in which he admitted to being a ‘talented but ultimately over-hyped middlebrow author’. Unsurprisingly, it was deemed a fake and was removed.
Still, the fur really began to fly as a result of postings from readers, not writers. When James McElroy’s We’ve Got Spirit, which documented a year in the life of a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well received by the mainstream press. But many of the people mentioned in it felt betrayed, and the books page on Amazon was an obvious outlet for their anger. Dozens of highly critical reviews were submitted - only to vanish a few days later.
Despite this episode, as far as Amazon was concerned, the fact that so many people were prepared to invest so much time reading and writing reviews was simply good for business. As readers’ reviews were supposed to be a ‘forum to talk about a book’ rather than a chat room, a particularly close eye was kept on bestselling books, to ensure that all reviews played by the rules.
This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page devoted to a less well-known book. The Story about Ping, a classic children's work that tells the story of a duck called Ping, was the inspiration for much geek humour, because ‘ping’ also happened to be the name of a software utility used to measure the degree of congestion on the Internet. One lengthy review constructed an elaborate analogy between the books plot and the architecture of the Internet, and concluded that the book provided a ‘good high-level overview’ of basic networking concepts.
Such silliness was, however, the exception rather than the rule. The striking thing about the vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com was how seriously their contributors took them. And overall the reviews collectively provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying.
The writer George Orwell once complained that ‘reviewing too many books involved constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever'. All the more reason, then, to regard the democratisation of the process as a good thing.",C2
"Citizen Kane

When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst, its alleged subject, might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. It is perhaps the one film, above all others, that has inspired people to become film-makers. This is all the more astonishing since it was Orson Welles’s first film. Welles always maintained that its success arose from his having no idea of what he was or wasn’t allowed to do: he just went ahead and did it. But he had an extraordinary team at his disposal, cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and the special-effects wizard Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz hit on the idea of portraying a newspaper magnate who both was and wasn’t Hearst, Welles realised that he had found a perfect vehicle for himself both as director and actor, and seized his chance with the energy of a whirlwind.

Dermot and Carmel

Dermot thought that Carmel was rather odd that morning. Twice he had said that he might be late and not to worry if he dropped into the golf club on the way home. He had to have a natter with someone and that was the best place to have it. Twice she had nodded her head amiably and distantly as if she hadn’t really heard or understood. 
‘Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?’ he had asked.
She had smiled. ‘Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I hadn’t anything to do all day so I was going to stroll down town and look at the shops. I was thinking that it was almost a sinful thing, just idling away the day.’
Dermot had smiled back. ‘You’re entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I”m late I won’t want anything to eat. So don’t go to any trouble.’
‘No, that’s fine.' she said.

Title Race 

Tea boy? Do you mind, I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator
Human nature provides the most divine of comedies. Witness a recent study which has informed the nation that job titles are a prime cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a leading firm of recruitment consultants found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues.
Most shockingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to forgo a pay rise in favour of a more ‘motivational’ or ‘professional’ job title. If our vanity is reaching such proportions that even basic greed is being overwhelmed, we are indeed in dire straits.
The truth is that in these brave new days of the early twenty-first century, nobody is content to be labelled subordinate. The titles under discussion place the emphasis on ability (specialist, coordinator) but are, in fact, little more than euphemisms.",C2
"Art

In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique, revolutionary, shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. But when we get to the art of our own day, we get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far, that what he does can no longer be called art. Or, rather, the media say it for us. And, on the whole, we agree because we expect to be puzzled by art’s insistent newness - so much so that we do not notice the old themes, methods and also virtues that the art of our own time is full of.
We require artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive, so vigorous that conventions cannot contain them. Previous ages went to artists with commissions: people needed art for specific purposes, and it was part of their ordinary life. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

Picture This

I am going to describe a situation, and then ask a crucial question about it. I hope it doesn’t strike you as unduly gnomic. But if it does, that’s modern art for you.
Here's the situation. An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book. The text considers the diversity of pictures. 'What are they all about?’ it asks dumbly, before deciding, even more dumbly: 'There is no end, in fact, to the number of different kinds of pictures.’ Okay, this is kiddy-language, and so far all it has betrayed is kiddy-thinking. But stick with me, all you adults out there. The situation is about to complicate itself.
Having settled on his text, the man then asks someone else to make a canvas for him, to stretch it and prime it, and then to take it along to a sign painter. He asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. And he gives the sign painter specific instructions not to attempt anything flashy or charming with the lettering. The sign painter does all this. On a white canvas, in simple black letters, he writes the chosen text. So my crucial question is this: is the finished product a painting?

Underground Encounters

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

It is an unspoken rule of commercial success as a painter that once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam, and attempts to strike out in a new direction are usually met at best with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.
Why this should be I’m not entirely sure. Gallery owners obviously prefer safe bets, and perhaps the art-buying public is insecure and needs the comfort of continuity. A few artists break the mould and get away with it. Picasso and Hockney are two prime examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now gamely running contrary to form, and it remains to be seen if he can pull it off. His new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground.
Railways hold a peculiar charm for Rimmington. From drawings made in the 1980s of the railway land of Londons Kings Cross Station, it was a logical step to go beneath the ground and look at what was happening below. The sketches have provided the material for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings which convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.

Extract from a novel

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I do not know why I use the word ‘escape’. The villagers say jokingly that only a sick man would choose such a remote place to rebuild. Well then, I have come here to heal myself, if you like to put it that way.
Apart from the wrinkled old peasant who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke of the uselessness of art but added nothing truthful about its consolations. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side. Our common actions in reality are simply the sackcloth covering which hides the cloth-of-gold - the meaning of the pattern. For us artists there waits the joyous compromise through art with all that wounded or defeated us in daily life; in this way, not to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination. Otherwise why should we hurt one another?",C2
