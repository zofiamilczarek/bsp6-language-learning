       "' Life on Mars  \\nA new study published in the journal  Science shows definitive evidence of organic matter on \\nthe surface of Mars.  The data was collected by NASA’ s nuclear -powered rover Curiosity. It \\nconfirms earlier findings  that the Red Planet once contained carbon- based compounds. These \\ncompounds – also called organic mo lecules – are essential ingredients for life as scientists \\nunderstand it.  \\nThe organ ic molecules were found in Mars’s Gale Crater, a large area that may have been a \\nwatery lake over three billion years ago. The rover encountered traces of the molecule in \\nrocks extracted from the area. The rocks also contain sulfur, which scientists speculate \\nhelped preserve the organics even when the rocks were exposed to the harsh radiation on \\nthe surface of the planet.  \\nScientists are quick to state that the presence of these organic molecules is not sufficient evidence for ancient life on Mars, as the molecules could have been formed by non -living \\nprocesses. But it’s still one of the most astonishing discoveries, which could lead to future \\nrevelations. Especially when one considers the other startling find that Curiosity uncovered around five years ago.  \\nThe rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it found the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane. One of the characteristics of methane is that it only survives a few hundred years. This means that something, somewhere on Mars, is replenishing the supply. According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet is breathing it.  \\nNASA suspects the methane comes from deep under the surface of the planet. The variations in temperature on the surface of Mars cause the molecule to flow upwards at higher or lower \\nlevels. For example, in the Martian winter the gas could get trapped in underground icy crystals. These crystals, called clathrates, melt in the summer and release the gas. However, the source of the methane is still a complete mystery.  \\nThe world of astrobiology considers both of these studies as historical milestones. According \\nto this information, Mars is not a dead planet. On the contrary, it is quite active and may be changing and becoming more habitable.  \\nOf course, this means further research is necessary. Scientists say they need to send new equipment to Mars, equipment that can measure the air and soil with more precision. There are already missions underway. The European Space Agency’ s ExoMars ship lands in \\n2020 and will be able to drill into the ground on Mars to analyse what it finds. Additionally,    \\n© 2019 British Council   www.britishcouncil.org/learnenglish  \\nNASA is sending another Mars r over in the same year to collect samples of Martian soil and \\nreturn them to Earth.  \\nThe possibility of life on Mars has fascinated humans for generations. It has been the subject \\nof endless science -fiction novels and films. Are we alone in the universe or have there been \\nother life forms within our Solar System? If the current missions to the Red Planet continue, it looks as if we may discover the answer very soon.  \\n \\nTasks \\nTask 1  \\nAre the sentences true or false or is the information not given?  \\n1.

A lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances can result in unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication. Here are three basic areas of differences in the business etiquette around the world that could help stand you in good stead when you next find yourself working with someone from a different culture.  \n",
      "Addressing someone  \n",
      "When discussing this topic in a training course, a German trainee and a British trainee got into a hot debate about whether it was appropriate for someone with a doctorate to use the corresponding title on their business card. The British trainee maintained that anyone who wasn ’t a medical doctor expecting to be addressed as ‘ Dr’ was disgustingly pompous and full    \n",
      "  \n",
      "of themselves. The German trainee, however, argued that the hard work and years of \n",
      "education put into earning that PhD should give them full rights to expect to be addressed as ‘Dr’. \n",
      "This stark difference in opinion over something that could be conceived as minor and thus easily overlooked goes to show that we often attach meaning to even the most mundane practices. When things that we are used to are done differently, it could spark the strongest reactions in us. While many Continental Europeans and Latin Americans prefer to be addressed with a title, for example Mr or Ms and their surname when meeting someone in a \n",
      "business context for the first time, Americans, and increasingly the British, now tend to prefer using their first names. The best thing to do is to listen and observe how your conversation partner addresses you and, if you are still unsure, do not be afraid to ask them how they would like to be addressed.  \n",
      "Smiling  \n",
      "A famous Russian proverb states that ‘ a smile wit hout reason is a sign of idiocy ’ and a so -\n",
      "called ‘smile of respect ’ is seen as insincere and often regarded with suspicion in Russia. Yet \n",

      " In a piece of research done on smiles across cultures, the researchers found that smiling individuals were considered more intelligent than non- smiling people in countries such as \n",
      "Germany, Switzerland, China and Malaysia. However, in countries like Russia, Japan, South Korea and Iran, pictures of smiling faces were rated as less intelligent than the non- smiling \n",

      "with dishonesty.  \n",
      "Eye contact  \n",
      "An American or British person might be looking their client in the eye to show that they are paying full attention to what is being said, but if that client is from Japan or Korea, they might find the direct eye contact awkward or even disrespectful. In parts of South America and Africa, prolonged eye contact could also be seen as challenging authority. In the Middle East, eye contact across genders is considered inappropriate, although eye contact within a gender could signify honesty and truthfulness.  \n",
      "Having an increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of miscommunication, but it is vital that we also remember that cultural stereotypes can be detrimental to building good business relationships. Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and  our individual experiences of the world.
