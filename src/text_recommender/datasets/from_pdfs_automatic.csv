" Cultural expectations and leadership  
Gabriela worked for a multinational company as a successful project manager in Brazil and was transferred to manage a team in Sweden. She was excited about her new role but soon realised that managing her new team would be a challenge.  
Despite their friendliness, Gabriela didn’t feel respected as a leader. Her new staff would question her proposals openly in meetings, and when she gave them instructions on how to carry out a task, they would often go about it in their own way without checking with her. When she announced her decisions on the project, they would continue giving their opinions as if it was still up for discussion.  
After weeks of frustration, Gabriela emailed her Swedish manager about the issue s she was 
facing with her team. Her manager simply asked her if she felt her team was still performing, and what she thought would help her better collaborate with her team members. Gabriela found her manager vague and didn’t feel as if he was managing the situation satisfactorily.     
  
What Gabriela was experiencing was a cultural clash in expectations. She was used to a more 
hierarchical framework where the team leader and manager took control and gave specific instructions on how things were to be done. This more directive management style worked well for her and her team in Brazil but did not transfer well to her new team in Sweden, who were more used to a flatter hierarchy where decision making was more democratic. When Gabriela took the issue to her Swedish manager, rather than stepping in with directions about 
what to do, her manager took on the role of coach and focused on getting her to come up with her own solutions instead.  
Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede uses the concept of ‘ power distance ’ to describe 
how power is distributed and how hierarchy is perceived in different cultures. In her previous work environment, Gabriela was used to a high power distance culture where power and authority are respected and everyone has their rightful place. In such a culture, leaders make 
the big decisions and are not often challenged. Her Swedish team, however, were used to working in a low power distance culture where subordinates often work together with their bosses to find solutions and make decisions. Here, leaders act as coaches or mentors who encourage independent thought and expect to be challenged.  
When Gabriela became aware of the cultural differences between her and her team, she took the initiative to have an open conversation with them about their feelings about her leadership. Pleased to be asked for their thoughts, Gabriela’s team openly expressed that they were not used to being told what to do. They enjoyed having more room for initiative and creative freedom. When she told her team exactly what she needed them  to do, they felt that 
she didn’t trust them to do their job well. They realised that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to challenge or make changes to her decisions, and were able to explain that it was how they’ d always wor ked. 
With a better understanding of the underlying reasons behind each other’s behaviour, Gabriela and her team were able to adapt their way of working. Gabriela was then able to make adjustments to her management style so as to better fit the expectations of her team 
and more effectively motivate her team to achieve their goals.

" An email from a friend  
Hi! 
I’ve been meaning to write for ages and finally today I’m actually doing something about it. 
Not that I ’m trying  to make excuses for myself, it’s been really hard to sit down and write, as 
I’ve been moving around so much.  Since we last saw each other I’ve unpacked my bags in 
four different cities. This job has turned out to be more of a whirlwind than I expected, but it’s 
all good!  
I went from London to Prague to set up a new regional office there. Y ou know I’ d always 
wanted to go, but maybe I was imagining Prague in spring when I used to talk about that. 
Winter was really hard, with minus 15 degrees in the mornings and dark really early in the evening. But at least it was blue skies and white snow and not days on end of grey skies and rain, like at home. It’ s tough being away from home over Christmas, though, and Skype on 
Christmas Day wasn’ t really the same as being with everyone.  
From there I was on another three- month mission to oversee the set -up of the office in New 
York. Loved, loved, loved New York! It ’s like being in one big TV show, as everywhere looks 
just a little bit familiar. I did every tourist thing you can think of when I wasn’ t working, and    
  
must have spent most of my salary on eating out. It was really hard to leave for the next job, 
especially as I kind of met someone (!) More about Michael later ...  
So then I was posted to LA, which felt like a whole other country compared with the East Coast. I could definitely get used to that kind of outdoor, beach lifestyle, but I didn’ t spend as 
much time getting to know California as I could have because I was flying back to see Michael every other weekend. He came to see me when he could, but his job means he’ s often 
working at weekends, so he c ouldn ’t make the flight very often. Those three months flew by 
and then I was off again, to Frankfurt, which is where I am now. And … so is Michael! He got a month off work and we’ re trying to work out how we can be in the same place at the same 
time for a while. We figure the first step in that direction is getting married, which is also why I 
wanted to write – I can ’t get married without my o ldest friend there! The wedding’ s going to 
be at home in London in September and I hope you can come!  
Anyway, tell me all your news and I promise not to leave it so long this time!  
Lots of love,

"Human body parts and organs 
It goes without saying that humans (mammals identifiable as those that stand upright and are
comparatively advanced and capable of detailed thought) have pretty remarkable bodies, given all that
they've accomplished. (Furthermore, an especially intelligent human brain produced this text!) To be
sure, humans have overcome predators, disease, and all sorts of other obstacles over thousands of
years.
To fully understand and appreciate these accomplishments, let's take at some of the most well-known
parts of the human body!
The head, or the spherical body part that contains the brain and rests at the top of the human body,
has quite a few individual organs and body parts on it. (It should quickly be mentioned that hair
occupies the space on top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are located
on either side of the head.) From top to bottom, the eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can be
found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are below them, and are round,
orb-like organs that allow humans to see.
The eyes make way for the nose, or an external (sticking-out) organ that plays an important part in the
breathing and bacteria-elimination processes. Below that is the mouth, or a wide, cavernous organ
that chews food, removes bacteria, helps with breathing, and more. The mouth contains teeth, or
small, white-colored, pointed body parts used to chew food, and the tongue, or a red-colored,
boneless organ used to chew food and speak.
The neck is the long body part that connects the head to the chest (the muscular body part that
protects the heart and lungs), and the stomach, or the part of the body that contains food and
liquid-processing organs, comes below that.
The legs are the long, muscular body parts that allow humans to move from one spot to another and
perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains a thigh (a thick, especially muscular body part used to
perform strenuous motions; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible body part that
absorbs the shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). Feet can be found at the
bottom of legs, and each foot is comprised of five toes, or small appendages that help balance.
Arms are long, powerful body parts that are located on either side of chest, below the shoulders;arms
are comprised of biceps (the thicker, more powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner, more
flexible lower portion). Hands, or small, gripping body parts used for a tremendous number of actions,
are at the end of arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to grip objects.
The aforementioned shoulders are rounded body parts that aid arms' flexibility. One's back is found
on the opposite side of the stomach, and is a flat section of the body that contains important muscles
that're intended to protect the lungs and other internal organs, in addition to helping humans perform
certain motions and actions.

" The sharing economy  
If we look around us at the things we have purchased at some point in our lives, we would no doubt notice that not everything we own is being put  to good use: the thick woollen coat 
which we thought looked trendy despite the fact that we live in a tropical country, the smartphone that got put away when we bought ourselves the newest model, the car that only gets used at the weekends, or even the guest room in our house that somehow got turned into a storeroom.  
Those underutilised items may seem useless to some, but could be an asset to others. With the advent of the internet, online communities have figured out a way to generate profit from the sharing of those underused assets. Using websites and social media groups that facilitate the buying and selling of second -hand goods, it is now easier than ever for peer- to-peer 
sharing activities to take place. And this is known as the sharing economy.  
These  democratised online platforms are providing a chance for people to make a quick buck 
or two. To give an example, busy parents previously might not have bothered with setting up a stall at the local market or car boot sale to sell their children’ s old equi pment, but with 
online marketplaces, parents are now able to sell on those hardly worn baby clothes that their    
  
children have outgrown and the expensive pushchairs and baby equipment they have 
invested in, so as to put some cash back into their pockets.  
Businesses have also caught on to the profitability of the sharing economy and are seeking to 
gain from making use of those underutilised resources. A business model that has rapidly risen in popularity sees companies providing an online platform that puts customers in contact with those who can provide a particular product or service. Companies like Airbnb  act 
as a middleman for people to cash in on their unused rooms and houses and let them out as lucrative accommodation. Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time.  
This move towards a sharing economy is not without criticisms. Unlike businesses, unregulated individuals do not have to follow certain regulations and this can lead to poorer and inconsistent quality of goods and services and a higher risk of fraud. Nevertheless, in the consumerist society we live in today, the increased opportunities to sell on our unwanted and underused goods can lead to a lesser impact on our environment.

Circle the best answer.  
1. The sharing economy does not involve …  
a. people selling their used things to others.  
b. people offering their services to others.

" Millennials in the workplace  
Background  
Millennials (those born between the early 1980s and the early 1990s) make up a huge part of our workforce but they seem to lack loyalty to the companies and the leaders they work for. Multinational companies are noticing larger turnover rates of millennials as employee retention rates fall. This report looks at the findings of two large- scale surveys on the mindset 
of the millennial generation and explores how organisations can strive to address these needs, increase employee engagement and encourage retention.  
Research  
In a global survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), more than 40,000 millennial (born between 1983 and 1993) and non- millennial responses were collected on the topics of 
workplace culture, communication and working styles, pay structure, career development, work –life balance, etc.     
  
In a separate global survey conducted by Deloitte, more than 10,000 millennials participated 
in a study about their perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work.  
Key findings  
• Millennials are as committed to their work as their more senior colleagues.  
• Millennials value interesting work and a good work –life balance. They do not believe 
that excessive work demands are worth sacrifices in their personal lives.  
• Millennials want flexibility in their working hours and are willing to give up pay increases and promotions for a flexible working schedule. They believe that success should be measured by productivity and not by the number of hours they are seen in an office.  
• Millennials want to feel supported and appreciated by their company and their 
superiors.  
• Millennials want more opportunities to develop their skills. These include technological skills, teamwork and interpersonal skills.  
• Millennials believe that businesses and business leaders should contribute to the improvement of society and they are more likely to be loyal to a company with strong ethics.  
Recommendations  
Organisations and managers wanting to retain millennials should consider:  
• monitoring their workload and satisfaction levels with their work –life balance  
• creating a flexible work culture where employees have more control over their working hours and their work location  
• providing meaningful work and interesting opportunities  
• offering help and support in continuing professional development  
• changing the organisa tion’s goals from being mainly about profit- making to motives 
that address social concerns and solve wider societal problems.

d. increase the job satisfaction of the millennials who are working for them.  
 3. According to the report, which of the following would millennials be happy to do?  
a. give up family time on weekends to finish a work project  
b. sacrifice pay so that they can work shorter hours  
c. be left to find their own developmental opportunities  
d. be committed to their companies ’ profit- making motives

" Why bridges collapse 
Some of the biggest and most expensive transportation projects in the world have involved building bridges. Bridges are crucial links that carry cars, trucks and trains across bodies of water, mountain gorges or other roads. As a result, they are one of the most important aspects of civil engineering and are subject to intense scrutiny, especially when they collapse.  
Bridge collapses can be tragic events, leading to loss of life and serious property damage. That's why bridge engineers, designers and builders must always take their jobs very seriously. The best way for them to prevent these accidents is to understand why bridges collapse in the first place. Understanding bridge collapses can lead to major changes in the design, construction and safety of future building projects. The following are main reasons why bridges fall.  
Fire 
Historically, more bridges were made of wood and were much more susceptible to fire. This was particularly true of old -fashioned train bridges, where the spark created by the steel 
wheels and steel tracks could sometimes cause a bridge to catch fire and burn to the ground.     
  
During construction  
A large number of bridge accidents occur during the construction of the bridge itself. These 
accidents are often due to an error made by the engineers, such as a miscalculation. The 
bridge collapses under its own weight, and this can be deadly for the workers on it at the time.  
Earthquakes  
Earthquakes damage all structures, including bridges. Luckily, this kind of collapse is relatively  
infrequent, especially with modern bridges. Engineers have learned to design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement.  
By defect  
Some bridge collapses are mysteries, and engineers only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation. In some cases, this could happen because inferior -quality material 
was used in the construction, or because of a defect in a key piece of the bridge. In other cases, the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount  of weight and no more.  
Boat or train crash  
Both of these kinds of accidents are extremely rare, but boats and trains can cause a bridge to collapse for different reasons. With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boat s, it's the very large mass they have that can bring about the collapse, 
even if they are moving very slowly when it occurs.  
The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents.

" Asteroids  
A 
In 2010, the planetary defence team at NASA had identified and logged 90 per cent of the 
asteroids near Earth measuring 1km wide. These ‘ near-Earth objects ’, or NEOs, are the size of 
mountains and include anything within 50 million kilometres of Earth’ s orbit. With an estimated 
50 left to log, NASA says none of the 887 it knows about are a significant danger to the planet.  
B 
Now NASA is working towards logging some of the smaller asteroids, those measuring 140 
metres wide or more. Of the 25,000 estimated asteroids of this size, so far  about 8,000 have 
been logged, leaving 17,000 unaccounted for. Considering that a 19 -metre asteroid that 
exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth’ s orbit.  
C 
Whether NASA can find the remaining middle- sized NEOs depends on getting the money to 
build NEOCam, a 0.5- metre space telescope which would use infrared light to locate asteroids. 
If it did get the money, it could probably achieve its goal in ten years. Once logged, the planetary defence team would still need to work out how to defend the planet against being hit by the truly worrying asteroids – the PHAs.     
  
D 
‘Potentially Hazardous Asteroids ’ are rocks close enough to pass within 7.5 million 
kilometres  of Earth’ s orbit. NASA has created a map of 1,400 PHAs, none of which are 
expected to be a threat in the next one hundred years. With technology already available, 
NASA can track these objects and make predictions about possible impact, at which point two defence solutions could be launched.  
E 
The first is DART – the Double Asteroid Redirection Test.  Plans are scheduled to test DART on 
the moon of an asteroid called Didymos. ‘Didymoon’ is 150 metres wide, orbitin g its 800-
metre mother, and hopefully the impact of DART will knock  it out of its orbit enough for Earth-
based telescopes to pick up.  
F 
Another suggested defence against a PHA on course to hit Earth is to blow it up using a nuclear weapon. It may sound like a plot from a film, and it was the subject of the 1998 film Armageddon , but the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response 
(HAMMER) is a genuine NASA proposal. The eight- ton rockets would be fired at an 
approaching asteroid with the hope of bumping it off course. If the asteroid was too close to 
Earth for this plan to work, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to blow it up instead.

" A short story extract  
Sam squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail raked up by the car on its way up to the 
Big House. The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, not caring about their owner ’s first 
visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter didn’ t come out here unless he had to, which was 
just fine by Sam. The more he kept out of his boss ’s way, the longer he’ d have a job.  
Carter came by later while Sam was chopping wood. Carter lifted his hat as if he were waiting 
for an appointment with the town priest, and then removed it completely as if he were talking to his mother. He pulled out a pile of paper from his back pocket and held it out.  
‘Don’t pick up your mail often, do you? ’ 
Sam took it without a glance and dropped the envelopes onto the bench.  
‘Never, ’ he replied and waited for Carter to say why he was here. The fact it was Carter ’s 
house was no explanation and they both knew it. Carter twisted his hat round and round, licking his lips and clearing his throat.  
‘Nice work fixing those fences,’ he said finally.  
‘I’ll be back to the beginning soon, ’ Sam said. It wasn ’t a complaint. A fence that took a year to 
repair meant another year ’s work to the man who did it well.  
‘Don’t you ever want to take a holiday? ’    
  
‘And go where? ’ A holiday meant being back out in the real world, a place even people like 
Carter travelled to escape from. Sam ’s escape was his reality and he wasn’ t going back.  
Mr Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt drew 
together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work.  
‘I’ve brought my son with me on this trip. He’ s had some trouble at school. ’ Mr Carter ’s eyes 
flicked up, blinked rapidly  and then shifted back to the hat occupying his hands. ‘ Not much 
trouble out here for a y oung boy. ’ He attempted a laugh but it came out like a dog ’s bark.  
The two men looked towards the northern end of the property. It stretched as far as the eye could see. Even the fences were barely visible from where they stood. However bored and rebelliou s a teenage boy might get, it wasn’ t possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the 
biggest of the horses, kicking at the ground with its heavy hooves. Could the boy ride? he wondered. There was a whole load of trouble a good rider could get into out here, miles away from anyone. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father.

I work in a fairly traditional office environment doing a typical nine- to-five job. I like my job, but 
it’s annoying that my commute to work takes an hour and a half each way and most of my 
work could really be done online from home. But my boss doesn’t seem to trust that we will get any work done if left to our own devices, and everyone in the company has to  clock in a nd 
out every day. It’s frustrating that they feel  the need to monitor what we do so closely instead 
of judging us based on our task performance, like most companies do these days.  
 
     
  
Jo 
I used to do a typical five- day week, but after I came out of my parental  leave, I decided that I 
wanted to spend more time with my children before they start school. After negotiating with 
my boss, we decided to cut my working week down to a three- day work week. This of course 
meant a significant cut in my pay  too, as I’ m paid on a pro- rata basis. I’ve since no ticed , 
though, that my workload hasn’t decreased in the slightest! I’ m now doing five days ’ worth of 
work in three days, but getting paid much less for it! I find myself having to take work home just so that I can meet the deadlines. It’s wearing me out trying to juggle work with looking 
after my children and my family, but I don’t dare to bring this up with my boss because I think he feels as if he’s made a huge concession letting me come in only three days a week.  
 
Marcus  
I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters is in the States, I do all my work online from home. That means that I don’t waste time commuting or making idle chit-chat with colleagues. I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes sk ipping dinner 
to finish a task. It can also get quite lonely working on my own, and I sometimes miss sharing ideas with colleagues.  
 
Lily 
I’m a freelancer and work for myself. This is great because I am in control of what I do and 
how I spend my time. At first, I was working from home, but I found it really hard to concentrate. There were just too many distractions around: housework that needed doing, another cup of tea, my family members wanting my attention for various things. So I started to go to a nearby café to work , but the Wi -Fi connection wasn’t ideal and I found myself drinking 
too much coffee. In the end, I decided to rent a desk in a co -working space with five other 
freelancers like myself. I liked getting dressed to go to work in the morning and being able to focus in an office environment. The other freelancers do similar kinds of web-based work to 
me and so it’s nice to have workmates to bounce ideas off as well.

"Las Vegas 
Last April, John took a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western
portion of the United States. The town is most popular for its casinos, hotels, and exciting nightlife.
In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 2.5 mile stretch of shopping,
entertainment venues, luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. This is probably the most commonly
visited tourist area in the city. The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. All of the buildings light up
with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention. A stay in Las Vegas can feel similar to a
visit to many popular cities worldwide. Many of the hotels have miniature versions of important
international sites and monuments. These famous landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, Venice, and
even ancient Rome.
One day, John took a side trip outside of the city to visit the Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders
of the Natural World. The canyon offers a breathtaking view of Nevada's ridges and natural landscape.
John especially liked the canyon because it was removed from all of the noise and movement in
downtown Las Vegas.
John had a great time during his trip to Las Vegas. He did not win a lot of money in the casinos.
However, he managed to see a lot of amazing sites during his visit to this city that never sleeps.

"My family at home 
My family lives in a small house. It's simple but pretty. It has a large garden. I like to work in the garden
but my sister hates to work in the garden. She prefers to read. She reads in the morning, in the
afternoon and at night.
I give all of the vegetables to mom and dad. They like to cook in our small kitchen. I eat any vegetable
but my sister eats only a few.
My family always eats breakfast and dinner together. We talk. We laugh. Then my sister washes the
dishes. 
At night dad likes to listen to music. Mom works on the computer. I watch television. And my sister
reads.
Soon we go to bed. My parents go to bed late but my sister and I go to bed early. I'm ready to go to

""Do you know what you would like to drink?"" the waiter asks.
""Water and orange juice,” Sandra says.
""Thank you. Here are your menus,"" the waiter says.
The waiter brings water for Paul and orange juice for Sandra.

"At school 
Lucas goes to school every day of the week. He has many subjects to go to each school day: English,
art, science, mathematics, gym, and history. His mother packs a big backpack full of books and lunch
for Lucas.
His first class is English, and he likes that teacher very much. His English teacher says that he is a good
pupil, which Lucas knows means that she thinks he is a good student.
His next class is art. He draws on paper with crayons and pencils and sometimes uses a ruler. Lucas
likes art. It is his favorite class.
His third class is science. This class is very hard for Lucas to figure out, but he gets to work with his
classmates a lot, which he likes to do. His friend, Kyle, works with Lucas in science class, and they have
fun.
Then Lucas gets his break for lunch. He sits with Kyle while he eats. The principal, or the headmaster
as some call him, likes to walk around and talk to students during lunch to check that they are all
behaving.
The next class is mathematics, which most of the students just call math. Kyle has trouble getting a
good grade in mathematics, but the teacher is very nice and helpful.
His fourth class is gym. It is just exercising.
History is his last class of the day Lucas has a hard time staying awake. Many lessons are boring, and
he is very tired after doing gym.

Doctor Klein: Good morning, Cecilia, how are you feeling today?
Cecilia: I do not feel very well, Doctor Klein. I hope that you can treat my illness.
Doctor Klein: I'm sorry that you feel very sick. Tell me some of your symptoms so that I can give you a
proper diagnosis.
Cecilia: I have not felt well since yesterday afternoon. The symptoms began with a headache and a
gradual sore throat. I drank tea with lemon and honey, and I went to bed early. However, I am
extremely exhausted, and I don't feel any better today.
Doctor Klein: I have seen these symptoms recently in some of my other patients. I'll check your
temperature and examine your throat in order to give you a proper diagnosis.
Cecilia: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor Klein: Open up and say ""Ahhhhhh...”
Cecilia: ""Ahhhhhh...”
Doctor Klein: Oh, my! I can already see that your throat is very red. Your temperature of 100 degrees
indicates that you are running a mild fever. I am afraid that you might have the flu.
Cecilia: What is the best way to cure my symptoms?
Doctor Klein: You will need plenty of rest, and you should drink fluids frequently in order to stay
hydrated. You've also just started to show symptoms, so I can prescribe you a medication that can
reduce fever and shorten the duration of your illness.
Cecilia: Should I stay home from work as well?
Doctor Klein: Yes, you should remain in bed until the fever breaks. You should also wait until 24 hours
after the fever has broken before you return to work. You do not want to risk getting your coworkers
sick as well.
Cecilia: I suppose I will just take it easy and relax for a couple of days. Thank you, doctor, for all of your

"A great summer vacation 
I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end. I spent
eight days in Paris, France. My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful hotel
room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasn't even expensive. We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. I was
always interested in art, so that was a special treat for me. The museum is so huge, you could spend
weeks there. Henry got tired walking around the museum and said ""Enough! I need to take a break
and rest.”
We took lots of breaks and sat in cafes along the river Seine. The French food we ate was delicious.
The wines were tasty, too. Steve's favorite part of the vacation was the hotel breakfast. He said he
would be happy if he could eat croissants like those forever. We had so much fun that we're already
talking about our next vacation!

"Days of the week 
There are seven days of the week, or uniquely named 24-hour periods designed to provide scheduling
context and make time more easily measureable. Each of these days is identifiable by specific plans,
moods, and tones.
Monday is viewed by many to be the ""worst"" day of the week, as it marks the return to work following
the weekend, when most full-time employees are given two days off. Most students attend school in
the morning and return home in the afternoon (usually from about eight until three or seven until
two), and most workers go to work in the morning and return home in the evening (usually from nine
to five or eight to four).
Tuesday is the second day of the week, and is in many ways similar to Monday. Not a whole lot
changes, schedule-wise, between Tuesday and Monday; most individuals go to school or work and
return home to watch television, play video games, make plans with friends, spend time with family,
read, or engage in a similar leisure-related activity.
Wednesday is the third day of the week, and serves as the ""middle"" of the work week; some
individuals refer to Wednesday as ""hump day,"" as once its workday is complete, employees will have
passed the work-week ""hump,"" and will be on the downturn, as only two days on the job will remain in
the week.
Thursday is the fourth day of the week, and is viewed favorably by many, as it's rather close to the end
of the work week.
Friday is the fifth day of the week, and marks the end of the workweek and school-week for the vast
majority of employees and students. By Friday afternoon/evening, most students/workers cannot wait
to leave and go home, as they won't have to report back to school/work until Monday.
Saturday is perhaps the most highly regarded day of the week. Because Sunday follows it (and there is
presumably no work or school to attend, for most individuals), everyone is free to stay out (or awake)
until late at night, having fun with plans or other leisure-related activities. To be sure, Saturday is
generally thought of as a day to partake in hobbies that couldn't otherwise be enjoyed during the
regular week.
Sunday is the final day of the week, and is used by most as a day of rest. Fewer late-night plans are
made on Sundays, compared to Saturdays, as most individuals have to wake up for work or school on
Monday morning.

"The pet store 
George is at the pet store, looking at what kind of pet he might want to get for his birthday. George
asked if he could have a horse, but his parents said no because horses are too big.
First, he sees dogs and cats. Baby dogs are called puppies. Baby cats are called kittens. George likes
them because they are easy to take care of and can play a lot, but they will get bigger. George wants a
small pet.
Then George sees animals that have to live in a cage. He sees rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. Mice are
what you call more than one mouse. He likes these animals because they are small. Birds live in cages
too. George sees a parrot and a canary. He likes them all, but he doesn't want to clean the cage.
 
George sees the animals in tanks. The tanks full of water have fish and turtles in them. He thinks about
a goldfish but decides he likes the turtles more. There are also tanks with rocks and sand that have
snakes, spiders, and scorpions, but George is afraid of them. George likes the turtles best, but they
won't fit in the little fishbowls. Turtles need bigger tanks, so they can swim sometimes and hide
sometimes.
George decides he wants to get a turtle for his birthday. He buys a book on how to take care of a turtle

"Letter to a Friend 
Hi, Fred!
It's been a while since we have been in touch. How has your semester been?
 
I wanted to send you an email update to you let you know how things have been going during my
semester abroad here in Málaga, Spain. I've already been here for six weeks, and I feel like I am finally
adapting to the culture. I'm also speaking the language more fluently.
I arrived during the first week of September. The weather has been very nice. Even though it's
October, it's still rather sunny and warm. In fact, I went to the beach and swam in the Mediterranean
Sea earlier today.
I am living with a very welcoming host family. I have my own private bedroom, but we eat breakfast,
lunch, and dinner together. On Sundays, we eat a big home-cooked paella for lunch. In Spain, lunch is
usually the biggest meal of the day. It's also very common for the people to take a midday nap right
after a big meal. I am actually just waking up from my nap right now!
On weekdays, I take classes at the local university. There, I met several native Spanish speakers. They
have been very kind and patient with me. At first, I struggled to comprehend their Spanish, but now I
understand most of our conversations. They have commented that my Spanish has improved a lot
since we first met. Now, I am more confident to use the language in other places like stores and
restaurants.
I am so glad that I decided to spend the semester here in Spain. We have an extended weekend
coming up, so a group of my friends and I are going to travel to France for four days. It's so easy and
inexpensive to travel internationally in Europe. I love it!
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Like I said, don't hesitate to stay in touch more often.
Perhaps you could even come to visit! What do you think?
Best wishes,

"Going to the Supermarket 
Martha is at the grocery store, getting ready for a house party. She has a list of what she needs with
her as she goes along. The first section she comes has produce. Martha sees apples, bananas,
cherries, grapes, and strawberries. She checks her list:
- 6 apples
- 1 bag of cherries
- 1 bag of grapes
- 2 cartons of strawberries
Martha get her items and looks the bananas. They are on sale for much cheaper than they are
normally. She picks 3 bananas. Next are vegetables. She sees potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, onions,
mushrooms, and salad in bags. She checks her list:
- 5 pounds of potatoes
- 6 carrots
- 4 tomatoes
- 2 onions
- 4 mushrooms
As she is putting her items into her cart, Martha checks the many bags of salad and chooses 2 of them.
She pushes her cart ahead. The next section is meat and dairy. She sees meat, fish, cheese, eggs, and
milk. She checks her list:
- 2 fish (salmon)
- 1 block of cheese (cheddar)
 - 1 dozen eggs
- 2 gallons of milk
She looks at the meat that is on sale and chooses a 5-pound roll of hamburger. She gets the rest of the
items in that section. She still needs rice, bread, salt, sugar, and flour. She gets:
- 2 bags of rice
- 4 loaves of bread
- a 2-pound bag of sugar
 - a 2-pound bag of flour
Martha then realizes that she has forgotten something. She runs back and gets 1 container of salt and
then rushes to the checkout. She puts her groceries into her car and leaves.

"Numbers 
Most individuals don't think about numbers, or numerical representations of quantity, but they play a major
part in everyday life. To be sure, numbers determine the time individuals will wake up in the morning, how
much money employees earn per hour, what day of the year it is, and much, much more.
Additionally, numbers impact everyday living on a much smaller scale. In the grocery store, for instance,
numbers determine products' prices, the amount of a product available for purchase, how much money
will need to be paid for products, and a whole lot else.
To understand larger (and more intimidating numbers), interested persons first need to understand basic
numbers, or numbers from one to ten, as they comprise each and every advanced number, or a multi-digit
number that indicates a larger amount/quantity.
The basic numbers are as follows:
One (1) - Example: ""He purchased one watermelon from the grocery store.""
Two (2) - Example: ""She bought two types of bread from the store.""
Three (3) - Example: ""He decided to get three bags of onions when he went shopping.""
Four (4) - Example: ""In preparation for the party, Janice bought four cartons of ice cream at the store.""
Five (5) - Example: ""Joe picked up five boxes of cereal from the breakfast aisle.""
Six (6) - Example: ""A pound of beef costs a lot of money at my favorite grocery store.""
Seven (7) - Example: ""Seven of the 10 aisles at my local grocery store contain pasta.""
Eight (8) - Example: ""I bought eight cookies for the price of four at the store.""
Nine (9) - Example: ""There were only nine loafs of bread left at the grocery store.""
Ten (10) - Example: ""Ten pineapples sure is a lot, don't you think?""
After ten, eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), sixteen (16), seventeen (17),
eighteen (18), nineteen (19), and twenty (20) follow. These numbers are seen less in grocery stores, as
most prices are 10 dollars or less; it is however worth knowing these numbers, generally and, in terms of
grocery shopping, for when the bill must be paid.
After twenty, numbers such as twenty-five (25), fifty (50), seventy-five (75), and one hundred (100) follow.
So long as one knows the core number, or the number situated in the tens or hundreds position that
determines the general amount, understanding these more complicated numbers won't be difficult. For
example thirty-three (33) is simply ""thirty"" plus three; sixty-seven is ""sixty"" plus seven; and sixty-nine is
simply ""sixty"" plus nine.

"The Environment  
In our modern world, there are many factors that place the wellbeing of the planet in jeopardy. While
some people have the opinion that environmental problems are just a natural occurrence, others
believe that human beings have a huge impact on the environment. Regardless of your viewpoint, take
into consideration the following factors that place our environment as well as the planet Earth in
danger.
Global warming or climate change is a major contributing factor to environmental damage. Because of
global warming, we have seen an increase in melting ice caps, a rise in sea levels, and the formation of
new weather patterns. These weather patterns have caused stronger storms, droughts, and flooding
in places that they formerly did not occur.
Air pollution is primarily caused as a result of excessive and unregulated emissions of carbon dioxide
into the air. Pollutants mostly emerge from the burning of fossil fuels in addition to chemicals, toxic
substances, and improper waste disposal. Air pollutants are absorbed into the atmosphere, and they
can cause smog, a combination of smoke and fog, in valleys as well as produce acidic precipitation in
areas far away from the pollution source.
In many areas, people and local governments do not sustainably use their natural resources. Mining
for natural gases, deforestation, and even improper use of water resources can have tremendous
effects on the environment. While these strategies often attempt to boost local economies, their
effects can lead to oil spills, interrupted animal habitats, and droughts.
Ultimately, the effects of the modern world on the environment can lead to many problems. Human
beings need to consider the repercussions of their actions, trying to reduce, reuse, and recycle
materials while establishing environmentally sustainable habits. If measures are not taken to protect
the environment, we can potentially witness the extinction of more endangered species, worldwide
pollution, and a completely uninhabitable planet.

"Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918
The deadliest virus in modern history, perhaps of all time, was the 1918 Spanish Flu. It killed about 20
to 50 million people worldwide, perhaps more. The total death toll is unknown because medical
records were not kept in many areas.
The pandemic hit during World War I and devastated military troops. In the United States, for instance,
more servicemen were killed from the flu than from the war itself. The Spanish flu was fatal to a higher
proportion of young adults than most flu viruses.
The pandemic started mildly, in the spring of 1918, but was followed by a much more severe wave in
the fall of 1918. The war likely contributed to the devastating mortality numbers, as large outbreaks
occurred in military forces living in close quarters. Poor nutrition and the unsanitary conditions of war
camps had an effect.
A third wave occurred in the winter and spring of 1919, and a fourth, smaller wave occurred in a few
areas in spring 1920. Initial symptoms of the flu were typical: sore throat, headache, and fever. The flu
often progressed rapidly to cause severe pneumonia and sometimes hemorrhage in the lungs and
mucus membranes. A characteristic feature of severe cases of the Spanish Flu was heliotrope
cyanosis, where the patient's face turned blue from lack of oxygen in the cells. Death usually followed
within hours or days.
Modern medicine such as vaccines, antivirals, and antibiotics for secondary infections were not
available at that time, so medical personnel couldn't do much more than try to relieve symptoms.
The flu ended when it had infected enough people that those who were susceptible had either died or
developed immunity.

" Cultural behaviour in business  
Much of today ’s business is conducted across international borders, and while the majority of 
the global business community might share the use of English as a common language, the nuances and expectations of business communication might differ greatly from culture to culture. A lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances can result in unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication. Here are three basic areas of differences in the business etiquette around the world that could help stand you in good stead when you next find yourself working with someone from a different culture.  
Addressing someone  
When discussing this topic in a training course, a German trainee and a British trainee got into a hot debate about whether it was appropriate for someone with a doctorate to use the corresponding title on their business card. The British trainee maintained that anyone who wasn ’t a medical doctor expecting to be addressed as ‘ Dr’ was disgustingly pompous and full    
  
of themselves. The German trainee, however, argued that the hard work and years of 
education put into earning that PhD should give them full rights to expect to be addressed as ‘Dr’. 
This stark difference in opinion over something that could be conceived as minor and thus easily overlooked goes to show that we often attach meaning to even the most mundane practices. When things that we are used to are done differently, it could spark the strongest reactions in us. While many Continental Europeans and Latin Americans prefer to be addressed with a title, for example Mr or Ms and their surname when meeting someone in a 
business context for the first time, Americans, and increasingly the British, now tend to prefer using their first names. The best thing to do is to listen and observe how your conversation partner addresses you and, if you are still unsure, do not be afraid to ask them how they would like to be addressed.  
Smiling  
A famous Russian proverb states that ‘ a smile wit hout reason is a sign of idiocy ’ and a so -
called ‘smile of respect ’ is seen as insincere and often regarded with suspicion in Russia. Yet 
in countries like the United States, Australia and Britain, smiling is often interpreted as a sign 
of openness, friendship and respect, and is frequently used to break the ice.  
 In a piece of research done on smiles across cultures, the researchers found that smiling individuals were considered more intelligent than non- smiling people in countries such as 
Germany, Switzerland, China and Malaysia. However, in countries like Russia, Japan, South Korea and Iran, pictures of smiling faces were rated as less intelligent than the non- smiling 
ones. Meanwhile, in countries like India, Argentina and the Maldives, smiling was associ ated 
with dishonesty.  
Eye contact  
An American or British person might be looking their client in the eye to show that they are paying full attention to what is being said, but if that client is from Japan or Korea, they might find the direct eye contact awkward or even disrespectful. In parts of South America and Africa, prolonged eye contact could also be seen as challenging authority. In the Middle East, eye contact across genders is considered inappropriate, although eye contact within a gender could signify honesty and truthfulness.  
Having an increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of miscommunication, but it is vital that we also remember that cultural stereotypes can be detrimental to building good business relationships. Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and  our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of 
the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.  
    
  
Tasks

" Giving and receiving positive feedback  
Your manager stops you and says she needs to have a word about your performance in the recent project. You worry about it all weekend, wondering what you might have done wrong. When you step into her office on Monday morning she begins by praising you for the good work you’ ve done on the project, and you wonder if this is the obligatory praise that starts off 
the typical ‘feedback sandwich’ . You know how th e feedback sandwich goes: say something 
nice, say what you really want to say, say something nice again.  
In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative,  but should be delivered so as to 
reinforce and encourage good performance. Below are three tips to help you make positive feedback count.     
  
1. Don’ t always follow positive feedback with negative feedback  
When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can 
become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.  
2. Cult ivate a ‘ growth mindset ’ 
Psychologist and ‘ growth mind set’ proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain 
and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with. Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. ‘ You 
really have an eye for details ’ or ‘You have a real talent for organising events’ . However, 
research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, 
experimentation and problem -solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new 
skills and the continued honing of talents.  
3. Create a culture of offering positive feedback  
Make giving positive feedback part of your team/department/company culture. Don’ t just wait 
for special moments like appraisals to give feedback. Offer informal positive feedback when making small talk or when walking down a corridor. Feedback doesn’ t have to only come from 
the higher ranks either. Encourage peer feedback among team members and colleagues and actively ask them for positive comments on each other’s performances on tasks.  
 
It might take time to counter the effects of an environment where there is a cynical view of 
positive feedback, but in the long run, by embracing positive feedback, you can not only enhance working performance but also enrich the quality of life in the workplace.  
 
Tasks 
Task 1  
Circle the best answer.  
1.
 What does the ‘ feedback sandwich ’ involve?  
a. Giving positive feedback by accompanying it with negative feedback  
b. Giving negative feedback by accompanying it with positive feedback  
c. Creating a feedback culture in an organisation  
d. Devaluing positive feedback  
2. The writer believes that the ‘feedback sandwich’  … 
a. can encourage good performance.  
b. makes negative feedback more painful.  
c. makes employees fearful of feedback . 
d. is too predictable to be effective. 
    
  
3. The ‘growth mindset’  idea is that ...  
a. we can become good at things that we might initially not seem to have a talent for.  
b. we should focus on honing the talents that we are born with . 
c. the end result is more important than the process . 
d. we must not tell people that they are good at certain things . 
 
4. How can we create a culture of positive feedback?  
a. By offering feedback only during informal occasions such as when walking down a 
corridor 
b. By making sure that only positive and not negative feedback is given  
c. By asking your employees to of",C1
"The Grand Canyon 
The Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, is located in the state of Arizona.
It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Formed by over 70 million years of erosion from the Colorado
River, the Grand Canyon offers a spectacular view. The canyon spans 277 miles in length, up to 18
miles in width, and it measures over a mile in depth at its deepest points. Carlos always wanted to visit
the Grand Canyon, and recently he received the chance to hike some of the trails and take several
panoramic photographs during his visit.
When Carlos arrived at the visitor center, he watched a brief movie that taught tourists about the
Grand Canyon National Park and the geological history of the canyon's formation. Later, Carlos
followed a hiking trail to become even further acquainted with the canyon. While walking through the
trails, Carlos saw some tourists riding donkeys to traverse the canyon's ridges. Throughout his hiking
expedition, Carlos used a map to find some of the best hot spots for photographs within the canyon.
He revisited some areas at different points in the day because sun angles and lighting can make a big
difference in the quality of a photo. Carlos was very pleased that he got to travel to the Grand Canyon.
He loves hiking and photography, so this was the perfect outdoor experience for him. He posted all of
his best pictures on social media, and his friends were amazed by his breathtaking, panoramic shots.

"Yellowstone National Park 
Yellowstone National Park, located in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, was established as the first

park, exploring its natural surroundings. In the forest, they saw a lot of local wildlife. Lisa was
surprised to see a family of grizzly bears, some gray wolves, and even bald eagles flying overhead.
Outside of the woods, they admired the beauty of some of Yellowstone's natural cascades.
Since Yellowstone contains many hot springs and the world's largest area of active geysers, Lisa and
her friends visited many different geyser sites. They even spent an afternoon swimming in
Yellowstone's Boiling River. Of all of the sites, Lisa and her friends agreed that Old Faithful was the
most impressive. Lisa and her friends waited patiently for the geyser to erupt. After about 40 minutes,
a stream of boiling water over 100 feet tall sprayed from the ground and up into the air. Fortunately,
no one got wet!

"Thanksgiving 
Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated predominantly in North America, and it possesses a different
meaning in each of the countries where it's acknowledged.
In the United States, Thanksgiving is a federal holiday (meaning all government employees and most
private employees are given a day off of work), and always takes places on the Fourth Thursday in
November, regardless of the date.
The holiday signifies the immense progress made by pilgrims, or some of the first travelers to North
America, at Plymouth Plantation circa 1621. It was at this time that the hungry and weary Pilgrims
were taught (by Native Americans) how to grow and produce food on North America's unique terrain.
Once they'd grown (and caught) an abundance of food, the Pilgrims were expectedly thankful, and
they celebrated alongside the Native Americans who provided them with such valuable assistance.
President Abraham Lincoln initiated the contemporary practice of Thanksgiving by calling for a ""day of
Thanksgiving"" during one of his Civil War addresses.
In America today, Thanksgiving remains firmly engrained in its historical roots, and is widely
considered to be a day for giving thanks for good food, good times, and family. Thanksgiving dinner
generally consists of turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, vegetables, gravy, and ample desserts. To be
sure, indulging in abundance is a cornerstone of the holiday, as doing so could only be possible if one
possesses abundance.

"San Francisco 
In June, Diane visited her friends who live in San Francisco, California. This was Diane's first time in the
city, and she enjoyed her opportunities to walk around and explore.
On the first day of her trip, Diane visited the Golden Gate Bridge. This red suspension bridge measures
1.7 miles in length. Diane and her friends did not walk across the bridge. However, they viewed it from
the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which offers hiking trails, picnicking areas, and presents
spectacular views of the bridge and city. Diane and her friends made sure to take a group photograph
here, featuring the bridge in the background.
The next day, Diane and her friends visited Alcatraz Island. This island is located 1.25 miles offshore in
the San Francisco Bay. It used to serve as a lighthouse, military fort, and prison. Diane and her friends
took a small tour boat across bay to reach the island. Their visit included a guided tour through the old
military base and prison. They also took a walk around the island to appreciate some of the native
wildlife in addition to the views of the city.
Diane and her friends spent the final day of her vist in San Francisco's downtown area. Diane's favorite
part of her entire trip was taking a trolley to transport her up and down the hilly streets of San
Francisco. Diane did a lot of shopping downtown on her last day. She and her friends celebrated the
end of her visit by having dinner at one of San Francisco's best restaurants.

"Christmas 
A Christian holiday signifying the birth of Jesus, Christmas is widely celebrated and enjoyed across the
United States and the world. The holiday always falls on 25 December (regardless of the day of the
week), and is typically accompanied by decorations, presents, and special meals.
Specifically, the legend behind Christmas (and the one that most children are told) is that Santa Claus,
a bearded, hefty, jolly, and red-jacket-wearing old man who lives in the North Pole, spends the year
crafting presents with his elves, or small, festive, excited Santa-assistants. All the children who behave
throughout the year are admitted to the Good List, and will presumably receive their desired gifts on
Christmas, while those who don't behave are placed on the Naughty List, and will presumably
(although the matter is determined by parents) receive a lump of coal.
Santa Claus is said to fly around the Christmas sky in a sled powered by his magical reindeer, or
cold-resistant, mythically powered, individually named animals, delivering presents to each child's
house in the process. Santa is also expected to slide through chimneys to deliver these presents
(homes not equipped with chimneys might ""leave the front door cracked open""), and children
sometimes arrange cookies or other treats on a plate for him to enjoy.
Gifts are placed underneath a Christmas tree, or a pine tree that's decorated with ornaments and/or
lights and is symbolic of the holiday. Additionally, smaller gifts may be placed inside a stocking, or a
sock-shaped, holiday-specific piece of fabric that's generally hung on the mantle of a fireplace (homes
without fireplaces might use the wall). A Christmas tree's ornaments, or hanging, typically spherical
decorations, in addition to the mentioned lights, may be accompanied by a star, or a representation of
the Star of Jerusalem that the Three Apostles followed while bringing Baby Jesus gifts and honoring
him, in the Bible.

"Washington, D.C. 
Yesterday, Stephen returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. His visit
took place during the week prior to the Fourth of July. Logically, there were many activities and
celebrations in town in preparation for Independence Day. During his stay in the city, Stephen visited a
lot of important historical sites and monuments, and he left with a deeper understanding of the
political history of the United States.
Stephen spent a lot of time outdoors exploring the important monuments surrounding Capitol Hill. Of
course, he saw the White House from its outside gate at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Stephen also
visited the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, and the Lincoln Memorial. These statues
and pavilions are dedicated to former U.S. presidents. They commemorate the contributions that
these leaders made throughout American history. Washington, D.C. also has several war memorials
dedicated to fallen soldiers during the major wars of the 20th century.
Away from the Capitol Hill area, Washington, D.C. has many museums and art galleries worth visiting.
Stephen enjoyed his visit to Washington, D.C. because he learned a lot more about American history
after touring each important landmark.

"The four seasons 
The four seasons are spring, summer, fall, and winter, and although various areas of the United States
experience drastically different weather during these times, all portions of the country recognize the
seasons; winter in California may bring heat, and winter in New York may bring blizzards, but both
periods are nevertheless winter.
Following winter, spring begins on 20 March and ends on either 20 June or 21 June, in the United
States (this date may vary slightly from year to year and hemisphere to hemisphere). For most, spring
is a time of ""thawing,"" when the cold and snow of the winter are replaced by sunshine, reasonable
temperatures, green grass, and more. It is also the season wherein previously dormant bees and
butterflies reemerge, and when birds become more active.
Summer follows spring and spans from about 21 June to 22 September, in America. Summer is the
warmest, the longest, and (arguably) the liveliest of the four seasons; students from kindergarten to
college are given two or so summer months off from class, and to be sure, there are more young
individuals out and about during this season than any other. It's not uncommon to see shorts, t-shirts,
and sunglasses worn by those who're soaking up the summer's hot sun, and to stay cool, many
individuals crank the air conditioning, take a dip in a swimming pool, and/or explore the
ever-comforting ocean waves.
Autumn (or fall), more than being a simple precursor to winter, is one of the most beautiful and
exciting seasons. Spanning from 22 September to 21 December (technically, that is; snow will begin to
fall long before this latter date, in most parts of the country, leading many to classify the period as
winter) in the US, autumn is characterized by falling leaves, Halloween (on 31 October), and
Thanksgiving. During fall, traditional farmers harvest their produce, and the aforementioned falling
leaves change to gorgeous orange, red, and yellow colors; these colors are generally associated with
autumn itself, in turn.
In the US, winter spans from 21 December to 20 March, and is, as one would expect, the coldest of the
four seasons. In the eastern, northern, and central portions of the country, winter snowfall can be
considerable; in the western and southern portions of the country, winter snowfall is highly unlikely,
but temperatures nevertheless drop from their usual. Winter is most widely known for its snow and
the Christmas holiday, but it also boasts New Year's Eve (on December 31, in recognition of the start of
a new year) and other special days. Ice skating, sledding, ice hockey, and snowball fights are commonly
enjoyed winter activities.

"The Golden Gate Bridge 
Some of the most important landmarks in the United States include feats of architecture and modern
engineering. San Francisco, California, is a beautiful city on its own, but it is also home to The Golden
Gate Bridge, a 1.7 mile suspension bridge connecting the San Francisco Peninsula to the Marin
Headlands. The bridge holds the title of one of the Wonders of the Modern World according to the
American Society of Civil Engineers.
One of the most popular ways to appreciate the bridge is to take an excursion to the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area just outside of San Francisco. The park contains hiking trails, great spots for
picnicking, and offers some of the best vantage points for panoramic photographs of the bridge
leading into the city.
David recently had some friends visit him in San Francisco, and he made sure to include a visit to the
recreation area as part of their tour. They enjoyed walking through the trails, observing some of the
native wildlife, and even having a casual picnic in the park. David's friends were thankful that he
guided them through this impressive area of California. They made sure to take a group photograph
with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. David's friends had the picture framed, and they later
presented it to David in order to thank him for his hospitality during their stay.

"Jobs and Professions 
As has been the case for many years, jobs, or forms of employment wherein employees perform a
service or duty in exchange for financial compensation, play a prominent role in society. Furthermore,
all jobs—even those of seemingly little significance—are important, as they simply wouldn't exist if
their specific responsibilities weren't of value to employers (companies or persons that pay others for
their work), customers (individuals who pay money for a product or service), and the economy
generally.
Teachers, or educational professionals tasked with helping students understand certain subjects and
topics, are especially crucial today. In short, teachers help their students to become qualified for their
future careers.
Doctors, or medical professionals who specialize in providing health-related assistance to patients, are
some of the most respected individuals in America and the world. It's the responsibility of doctors to
help those who feel less-than-stellar to determine the underlying health issue(s) and recommend an
effective treatment (or remedy to a disease, disorder, or condition).
There are quite a few types of specialty doctors in America (besides MD, which simply means ""medical
doctor""), all of whom can be referred to simply as ""Doctor (Name)."" Dentists (mouth/teeth doctors),
dermatologists (skin doctors), and psychiatrists (mental-health doctors) are just a few examples of the
many different types of doctors.
Additionally, nurses are medical professionals who help to administer doctor-ordered treatments to
patients.
Police officers are law enforcement professionals whose job it is to protect citizens, solve crimes, and
assure that rules and regulations are followed. Similarly, firefighters serve the public by responding to
fires (and other emergency situations) and using high-tech equipment to extinguish these fires, while
bringing any individuals who're in danger to safety.
Farmers maintain fields of crops (or vegetable/fruit plants) and/or collections of animals with the
intention of selling these products as food.
Chefs/cooks prepare meals in professional settings, including restaurants, cafeterias, and other
venues wherein food and drink are sold, for customers. Chefs are generally experienced in cooking
and managing kitchens.
Waiters bring menus, beverages, meals, and ultimately, the check (or a bill of the foods and drinks
purchased in a transaction) to tables in restaurants and other establishments that serve food.
Artists produce art, or works of creative significance, including music, paintings, drawings, poetry,
writing, and more.

"London 
London is a famous and historic city. It is the capital of England in the United Kingdom. The city is quite
popular for international tourism because London is home to one of the oldest-standing monarchies
in the western hemisphere. Rita and Joanne recently traveled to London. They were very excited for
their trip because this was their first journey overseas from the United States.
Among the popular sights that Rita and Joanne visited are Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the
London Eye. Big Ben is one of London's most famous monuments. It is a large clock tower located at
the northern end of Westminster Palace. The clock tower is 96 meters tall. Unfortunately, Rita and
Joanne were only able to view the tower from the outside. The women learned that the tower's
interior is undergoing renovations until 2021.
Fortunately, the London Eye, the city's famous Ferris wheel, was open to the public. The London Eye is
situated along the southern shores of the Thames River. This attraction stands 135 meters high. It is
one of London's most well-known spots for gaining aerial views of the city. Each capsule of the Ferris
wheel can hold up to 25 passengers. When their capsule stopped at the top of the Ferris wheel, the
women took spectacular panoramic photographs of the beautiful cityscape below.
The last place that Rita and Joanne visited was Buckingham Palace, the home of the Queen of England.
The women were impressed by the palace's incredible architecture and historical value. Both Rita and
Joanne enjoyed watching the Queen's guards outside the palace. These guards wore red tunic
uniforms, shiny black boots, and bearskin hats. Despite the women's attempts to catch the attention
of the guards, the guards are specifically trained to avoid distractions. Because of this, the guards
ignored the women completely.
 
Joanne and Rita had an amazing time visiting the city of London, and they are inspired to seek more
international travel destinations in the future.

"Chicago 
Keith recently came back from a trip to Chicago, Illinois. This midwestern metropolis is found along the
shore of Lake Michigan. During his visit, Keith spent a lot of time exploring the city to visit important
landmarks and monuments.
Keith loves baseball, and he made sure to take a visit to Wrigley Field. Not only did he take a tour of
this spectacular stadium, but he also got to watch a Chicago Cubs game. In the stadium, Keith and the
other fans cheered for the Cubs. Keith was happy that the Cubs won with a score of 5-4.
Chicago has many historic places to visit. Keith found the Chicago Water Tower impressive as it is one
of the few remaining landmarks to have survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Keith also took a walk
through Jackson Park, a great outdoor space that hosted the World's Fair of 1892. The park is great for
a leisurely stroll, and it still features some of the original architecture and replicas of monuments that
were featured in the World's Fair.
During the last part of his visit, Keith managed to climb the stairs inside of the Willis Tower, a 110-story
skyscraper. Despite the challenge of climbing the many flights of stairs, Keith felt that reaching the top
was worth the effort. From the rooftop, Keith received a gorgeous view of the city's skyline with Lake
Michigan in the background.

"Halloween 
Halloween (also referred to as All Hollows' Eve) is a holiday that's celebrated in America on 31 October
of each year, regardless of what day of the week this date falls on. Although it is rooted in religion,
Halloween today is enjoyed mainly because of its decorations, costumes, candy, treats, and general
excitement, and furthermore, it is enjoyed by most everyone.
Before Halloween, many individuals carve a design into an orange-colored pumpkin, or a solid,
durable vegetable. Once a personally satisfying design is carved, a lit candle is typically put inside a
pumpkin, thereby making it a Jack-O-Lantern. At night, this design lights up against the darkness.
Besides carving pumpkins, some celebrate Halloween by putting decorations up. Supernatural
(referring in this case to non-natural creatures that're typically based in fiction) figures, including
vampires, ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and more, generally account for most of these decorations.
Bugs, spiders, cobwebs, gravestones, and anything else that can be considered creepy (or unusual and
possibly scary) can also be found on Halloween, in decoration form.
Only some adults celebrate Halloween, and they generally do so by attending parties. Inversely, the
vast majority of children dress in costume (Halloween costumes can be based upon anything, from the
mentioned supernatural creatures to the stars of today's films) and walk from door to door in search
of candy—a practice known as trick or treat—on Halloween. After knocking on a door (houses that
participate in Halloween usually leave a light on), one says, ""Trick or Treat"" and a piece (or pieces!) of
candy is given to him or her.

"Valentine's Day 
Valentine's Day (or Saint Valentine's Day) is a holiday that, in the United States, takes place on
February 14, and technically signifies the accomplishments of St. Valentine, a third-century Roman
saint.
With that said, most Americans, instead of honoring St. Valentine through religious ceremony, enjoy
the holiday by engaging in ""romantic"" behavior with their significant other or someone who they wish
to be their significant other; gifts, special dinners, and other acknowledgements of affection comprise
most individuals' Valentine's Day celebrations.
Chocolates and flowers are commonly given as gifts during Valentine's Day, as are accompanying
greeting cards (greeting card companies release new Valentine's Day designs annually). Red and pink
are generally understood to be ""the colors"" of Valentine's Day, and many individuals, instead of
celebrating romantically, spend the holiday with their friends and/or family members.
Variations of Valentine's Day are celebrated across the globe throughout the year. In America, the
holiday, although acknowledged by the vast majority of the population, isn't federally recognized; no
time off work is granted for Valentine's Day.

"Los Angeles  
Stephanie recently took a weekend trip to Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is a coastal city situated
along the Pacific Ocean. Many celebrities earned their claim to fame here. Although the town offers
many attractions centered around Hollywood culture, there is a lot to see and visit in Los Angeles.
Of course, all things related to Hollywood are popular tourist attractions. The Hollywood Sign, located
the Hollywood Hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, is a famous landmark for this star-studded town.
Once in downtown Hollywood, it's possible to take a stroll along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This
landmark contains more than 2500 brass stars dedicated to celebrities who have made a significant
impact on the entertainment industry. In Hollywood, visitors can even take tours of popular movie
studios. Stephanie had a chance to visit Universal Studios, which produces her favorite films.
Los Angeles is also a popular beach town, offering plenty of opportunities for sunbathing and surfing.
A common beach destination is the Santa Monica Pier, which offers rides and attractions to its visitors.
Here, Stephanie rode the iconic Ferris wheel, which offered her a spectacular view of the city and
coast.
These are just some of the things Stephanie experienced during her visit to Los Angeles. She loved her
trip, and she hopes to return someday soon.

"Food 
While eating at a restaurant is an enjoyable and convenient occasional treat, most individuals and
families prepare their meals at home. To make breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, these persons must
have the required foods and ingredients on hand and ready to go; foods and ingredients are typically
purchased from a grocery store, or an establishment that distributes foods, drinks, household
products, and other items that're used by the typical consumer.
Produce, or the term used to describe fresh fruits and vegetables, is commonly purchased by grocery
store shoppers. In terms of fruit, most grocery stores offer bananas, apples, oranges, blackberries,
raspberries, grapes, pineapples, cantaloupes, watermelons, and more; other grocery stores with larger
produce selections might offer the listed fruits in addition to less common fruits, including mangoes,
honeydews, starfruits, coconuts, and more.
Depending on the grocery store, customers can purchase fruits in a few different ways. Some stores
will charge a set amount per pound of fruit, and will weigh customers' fruit purchases and bill them
accordingly; other stores will charge customers for each piece of fruit they buy, or for bundles of fruit
(a bag of bananas, a bag of apples, etc.); other stores yet will simply charge by the container.
Vegetables, including lettuce, corn, tomatoes, onions, celery, cucumbers, mushrooms, and more are
also sold at many grocery stores, and are purchased similarly to the way that fruits are. Grocery stores
typically stock more vegetables than fruit at any given time, as vegetables remain fresh longer than
fruits do, generally speaking.
It'd take quite a while to list everything else that today's massive grocery stores sell, but most
customers take the opportunity to shop for staples, or foods that play a prominent role in the average
diet, at the establishments. Staples include pasta, rice, flour, sugar, milk, meat, and eggs, and bread. All
the listed staples are available in prepackaged containers, but can be purchased ""fresh"" in some
grocery stores, wherein employees will measure and weigh fresh products and then provide them to
customers.

"Miami 
Christina visited Miami during her winter vacation. She is from Boston, where it is cold during the
winter months. Miami, however, has a very warm climate. There are many sunny days in Miami, and
people can go to the beach all year long. Christina spent a good portion of her trip on the beach to
relax and sunbathe. However, she also explored Miami and its surroundings.
Inspired by Miami's proximity to the ocean, Christina visited the Miami Seaquarium to learn about
marine life. There, she watched a show using trained dolphins, killer whales, and other aquatic
mammals. She took a lot of pictures of the sea creatures jumping out of the water and performing
tricks.
Christina also took an excursion to the Everglades National Park. This park is a protected area
spanning 1.5 million acres. Because the park is mostly swampland, it is home to many reptiles. Native
animals include snakes, alligators, and crocodiles. The park is also great for birdwatching. Christina
enjoyed hiking the trails in the Everglades and observing the wildlife in its natural environment.
When Christina returned to the city, she visited Little Havana. This is Miami's Cuban neighborhood.
Christina could see that Little Havana's people demonstrated a lot of pride for their Cuban heritage.
There were many outdoor shops and vendors, live musicians, and the Cuban cuisine was delicious.
Little Havana was Christina's favorite part about her trip to Miami. This neighborhood made Christina
feel like she had traveled to Cuba without ever having to leave the United States.

"The Statue of Liberty 
The Statue of Liberty, arguably one of New York City's most iconic symbols, is a popular tourist
attraction for first-time visitors to the city. This 150-foot monument was gifted to the United States
from France in order to celebrate 100 years of America's independence. The statue is located on
Liberty Island, and it is accessible by taking a ferry from either Battery Park in New York City or Liberty
State Park in Jersey City.
When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of
freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are
permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs,
Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue's crown.
During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She
found out that because the statue's exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it
the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same
color as a shiny penny! After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York
City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have
had the time to explore more sites, but she can't wait to return to the city in the future.

"Going to work in the morning 
My job is a long distance from my home, almost 50 miles away. I have to wake up early every morning,
as I'm always in a rush. There's never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. At exactly 6:00 AM, I get
into my car and start the long drive.
I usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. During the morning rush hour, though, it's
not very enjoyable. The heavy traffic is a little bit annoying. So I always listen to my favorite classical
music CD's in the car - Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot.
The drive to work takes about one hour. Going back home in the evening after work takes even longer,
maybe around 70 minutes. Lately I've been thinking about trying to take the train to work instead of
driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same
time.

"The Empire State Building 
When exploring New York City, there are several different options for activities during a day trip. Some
visitors come to see a show, visit art museums, or simply to shop in many of the city's high-end
retailers. However, many tourists simply come to New York City for the sightseeing. One of the most
visited landmarks in New York City is the Empire State Building.
The Empire State Building, constructed in 1931, is a 102-story skyscraper, the ninth highest building in
the world, and the fourth tallest structure in the United States. It is located in Midtown, Manhattan.
This skyscraper is an iconic symbol of the city, having been featured in over 90 popular movies (as of
2018) throughout film history. Tourists come from all over the world to visit this building and view the
city from its famous observation decks.
Matthew, an enthusiast of historic buildings, was excited for this trip to New York City because he has
always appreciated architectural design. Matthew purchased a ticket that granted him access to
beautiful 360-degree views of the city. The ticket included an elevator ride that stopped at two
different vantage points, one at the 86th floor and the other at the rooftop observatory on the 102nd
floor. From these observation decks, Matthew took incredible photographs of the entire New York City
skyline. The rooftop views granted Matthew perfect aerial perspectives of Central Park, the Brooklyn
Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, and many other important city landmarks.
